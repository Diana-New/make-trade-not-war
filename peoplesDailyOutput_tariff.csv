The Agreement on Trade in Goods was signed by China's Vice Minister of Commerce Fu Ziying and Financial Secretary of the HKSAR government Paul Chan. The CEPA upgrade indicates the cooperation between the mainland and the HKSAR has entered a new stage, Fu said. Fifteen years after CEPA was signed, the latest upgrade is a milestone in economic and trade cooperation between the mainland and the HKSAR, Chan said. Upon signing the agreement, the two sides have completed in advance the objective of promoting the CEPA upgrade under the national 13th five-year plan (2016-2020), thus enabling CEPA to become a comprehensive and modern free trade framework agreement, covering four major areas, namely trade in goods, trade in services, investment, and economic and technical co-operation. The agreement consolidates and updates the commitments on liberalization and facilitation of trade in goods under CEPA, and further enhances the level of liberalization for trade in goods under CEPA. Starting from Jan. 1, 2019, goods of Hong Kong origin imported into the mainland will fully enjoy zero tariff through the enhanced arrangement for rules of origin (ROOs). In addition to the existing product-specific ROOs (PSRs), a general ROO based on the calculation of the value added to the products in Hong Kong is introduced under the agreement, thus allowing products currently without PSRs to instantly enjoy zero tariff upon importation into the mainland subject to the fulfillment of the general ROO. The agreement also establishes principles of trade facilitation, including stipulation of commitment of the two sides in facilitating trade between the two, simplifying customs procedures, enhancing transparency of related measures and strengthening cooperation, and in particular setting out measures to expedite customs clearance of goods to facilitate goods flow in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The measure, from Jan 1 to March 31, will postpone 25 percent tariffs on 144 taxable items and 5 percent tariffs for 67 items. The tariffs were imposed on US-made vehicles and auto parts in the summer, according to a statement on the Ministry of Finance website. The measure may expand imports of some goods needed by the market as well as helping to meet domestic households' demand, the statement said. The ministry also said it is hoped China and the US can speed up negotiations to remove all additional tariffs on each other's goods. President Xi Jinping and his United States counterpart, Donald Trump, agreed on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires on Dec 1 to continue bilateral trade negotiations, stop the imposition of new tariffs and exchange visits at an appropriate time. They agreed to a truce that delayed additional US tariff increases on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods starting on Jan 1. Mei Xinyu, a researcher at the International Trade and Economic Cooperation Institute at the Ministry of Commerce, said the move was to implement the consensus reached between the two leaders. China is implementing the consensus to show confidence in achieving a good result after further negotiations, Mei said. China cut tariffs on some imported vehicles and auto parts on July 1 by an average of 46 percent as a measure of further opening-up and to promote domestic consumption. After the July tariff reduction, the average tariff on cars was 13.8 percent, and 6 percent for auto parts, according to the Ministry of Finance. But after the United States raised its tariffs on Chinese vehicles and parts to 27.5 percent, China hiked its tariffs on US autos and parts. Chen Junbin, a research fellow at CITIC Securities, said when the tariff suspension takes effect, US auto sales in China may gradually rebound from the plunge sales took in the first three quarters. The country's auto industry is expected to continue to open up, Chen wrote in a recent report. The market share of imported cars in China is expected to rise to 8 percent in the long run, and their annual sales may exceed about 2 million units, he added. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

""It is good news for the world economy and markets that the heads of state of China and the United States had a constructive meeting and dinner on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Argentina,"" Wang said in the article titled ""A welcome pause in U.S.-China trade dispute,"" which was carried by the San Francisco Chronicle, the largest-circulation newspaper on the U.S. West Coast. During the dinner meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump agreed not to impose new additional tariffs. The United States and China have been locked in trade frictions since earlier this year when the U.S. government slapped punitive tariffs on Chinese exports to America, which forced China to retaliate in kind. ""It is in the interests of both sides to settle their differences, as they are economically intertwined,"" Wang said, adding that many Americans he had talked to hope the trade conflict could come quickly to an end and avoid further harms to U.S. companies from tariffs. Citing Apple as an example, Wang said more than 50 million iPhones were sold in the Chinese mainland in 2017, bringing the number of iPhone users there to more than 300 million, nearly the size of the U.S. population. The Buenos Aires meeting made it possible for U.S. companies to continue reaping extensive economic benefits from the opportunities generated by the growth of China, whose population of nearly 1.4 billion makes it one of the largest markets in the world, said Wang. It is predicted that in the coming 15 years, China will import over 30 trillion U.S. dollars in goods and over 10 trillion dollars in services, offering enormous opportunities for its trading partners, including the United States. Wang noted that it is natural for trading partners to have differences and even frictions, but ""as long as we work together, there is hope to find solutions to our differences."" ""A pause in raising tariff barriers is a step in the right direction"" for China and the United States to move forward to solve their trade disputes by peaceful means, said the Chinese consul general. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

""This is the first positive news we've seen after months of downturned prices and halted shipments,"" said ASA president John Heisdorffer in a statement released on Monday. Chinese President Xi Jinping and his U.S. counterpart, Donald Trump, agreed Saturday on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires to take measures to ease bilateral trade tensions. They agreed not to impose new additional tariffs, and to step up negotiations toward the removal of all additional tariffs and reaching a concrete deal that is mutually beneficial and win-win. If this suspension of tariff increases leads to a longer-term agreement, it will be extremely positive for the soy industry, said the statement. ""We want to begin repairing damage done to our trade relations with China, which has been essential to successful soybean exports for years,"" said Heisdorffer, a soybean grower from Iowa state, in the statement. China is the world's top soybean buyer. But amid the escalation of trade disputes, China cut down its soybean imports from the United States. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

On Saturday, President Xi Jinping met with his American counterpart Donald Trump in Argentina. According to the press releases that followed the meeting, both sides have agreed to halt further tariff escalations and to intensify their efforts at negotiation within the next 90 days, hoping to reach a deal to remove all of the additional tariffs imposed on each other since earlier this year. If these efforts fail, the United States is very likely to further escalate the trade war. The two heads of state have clearly put the brakes on escalating the trade frictions. A truce was reached, and room given for further consultations. These are positive outcomes to begin with. Nevertheless, trade teams from both sides will now engage in a new round of what are certain to be complicated and tough talks in the coming three months. Why did China and the United States reach this ceasefire? The main reason is that both sides have paid a price for the eight-month-long trade war. When their trade conflicts began escalating in March, the American side believed that it would be easy for them to win the battle. But the following eight months demonstrated that no one emerges a winner from a trade war - both sides lose. The United States trade deficit in goods reached $77.2 billion in October alone, which is a new record high. The automaker General Motors announced at the end of November that it will shut down seven plants around the world, including four in the United States, but none in China, resulting in huge pressure on the American government. At the same time, foreign direct investment flowing in the United States in the second quarter of the year slid in negative territory, with a divestment of $8.2 billion, the first time this has happened since the beginning of 2015. By contrast, as recently as 2017, the United States had FDI of $275 billion, the highest in the world. Obviously, the trade war did not help the United States to shrink its trade deficit, and neither did it lead to jobs or capital flowing back onshore. Instead, the trade war resulted in more risks to its economy. So, should the trade war continue? Even President Trump himself was reluctant to call it a trade war during his interview with CBS on Oct 14. Instead he said it was but a ""skirmish"", which he was considering cooling down. As it stands, the two presidents have pressed the ""pause"" button on the trade frictions. This is a wise choice that will benefit both sides. But the three months ahead will be critical â the economic and trade teams need to implement the consensus reached during Saturday's meeting, and come to an agreement. This would be a good thing for both China and the United States. The alternative would be a new round of trade conflict that brings greater uncertainty to both countries, and the world at large. Frankly, with only 90 days at hand, and given the complex nature of the China-US trade issues, the negotiating teams have an arduous task on their shoulders and a pressing deadline. On the ""structural issues"" raised by the American side, such as intellectual property rights protection, technological cooperation, market access, and non-tariff barriers, China's general stance is that the issues that conform with China's intentions regarding its reform and opening up should be the focal points on the negotiation agenda. China has also raised some of its core concerns to which the United States has responded. The coming round of negotiations is bound to be hard and complicated, as the two sides will bargain for deals, not to mention the fact that the American side had unexpectedly reversed course during previous negotiations. One also has to consider the internal divisions in the American team, and the broader domestic political situation in the United States. No matter what the outcome is, China is more likely to respond calmly. In meeting the challenges of the trade war, China's approach has always been consistent and clear: China does not want a trade war, but it is not afraid to fight to firmly defend the core interests of the nation and its people. Eight months of consultations had demonstrated China's resolve and trustworthiness. In the months ahead, China will undoubtedly make the utmost efforts to communicate with the American side, with the aim to do away with the tariffs for the benefit of both countries, and of the international trade system. At the same time, it will be neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic about the outcome. The past eight months have made more people in China realize that their best response to a trade war is ""doing their own things right"". As China marks the 40th anniversary of its reform and opening-up this year, this is both a moment to remember its past and to make a new starting point for promoting a higher level of opening-up. During this process, China and the United States have the opportunity to resolve their trade concerns and to realize win-win results if they come to the negotiations with sincerity, treat each other as equals, respect each other, and strive for mutual benefits. This is the way to properly address their differences. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

""I will be formally terminating NAFTA shortly,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One en route from the Group of Twenty (G20) summit in Argentina, according to a White House press release. ""Congress will have a choice of approving the USMCA, which is a phenomenal deal, much, much better than NAFTA,"" said Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to pull out of NAFTA entirely. The U.S. president, along with Canadian and Mexican leaders, signed the new deal, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), on Friday after more than a year of intense negotiations. Hailing the deal as ""modern and balanced,"" the president said at the signing ceremony that it has been ""well-reviewed"" and he doesn't expect to have much problem in Congress. The new deal has, however, generated a groundswell of opposition from lawmakers especially the Democrats, who will take control of the House in January, making a smooth passage unlikely. ""It's disappointing but not surprising"" that the U.S. president would try to force Congress to reinstate the status quo of #NAFTA, instead of working constructively with Congress to improve his proposed agreement, Henry Connelly, a spokesman for House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, said on Twitter Sunday morning. Pelosi, who is expected to take the role of House Speaker in January, has repeatedly expressed deep concerns over the deal's enforceability. ""We are waiting to see enforcement provisions relating to workers and the environment,"" Pelosi said Friday in a statement, describing the deal as a ""work in progress."" The USMCA requires at least 40 percent of car production to come from factories with an average wage of 16 U.S. dollars per hour. ""I think we should see if we can get it passed first,"" Republican Senator John Barrasso said on NBC News' Meet the Press Sunday. ""I want to see how many Democratic votes come on board for this."" U.S. Congress can suggest small changes to be made to the legislation, and many lawmakers have been waiting for an economic impact study from the U.S. International Trade Commission before making their final decision. The commission has up to 105 days, or by mid-March to complete a report. In a hearing held mid-November, John Bozzella, president of the Association of Global Automakers, said the new agreement could hurt the industry. The USMCA would raise the requirement for North American content in cars to a whopping 75 percent from 62.5 percent, among other things. Bozzella said automakers will need to invest in ""elaborate processes"" to ensure compliance with such rules, and suppliers will have to establish similar ""costly processes."" Meanwhile, a number of lawmakers and business groups are trying to push for the removal of U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico, which have inflicted harm upon American manufacturers and consumers, raising costs for a wide array of industries. ""While there's a lot to like in this new agreement, I'm disappointed that the Section 232 tariffs on Canada and Mexico still remain in place,"" Republican Senator Rob Portman said in a statement on Friday. Business Roundtable, an influential association of leading U.S. companies' executives, also called for a ""prompt resolution"" of the tariff issue between all three countries while reviewing the final text of the new trade agreement. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump reached important consensus during their working dinner Saturday, said Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi when briefing the media on the Xi-Trump meeting after the Group of 20 summit in Argentina's capital city of Buenos Aires. Wang said both heads of state have agreed to ""have further exchange of visits at an appropriate time,"" continue the trade talks between the two countries and stop imposing new tariffs. As the world economy is facing downward pressure and becoming more uneven, analysts said that the consensus was conducive to easing market fears over the escalation of new trade restrictive measures between the world's two biggest economies. In his speech at G20 summit, Xi said that the number of new trade restrictive measures applied on a monthly basis among G20 members had doubled compared with six months ago. In 2018, the growth of trade in goods may decline by 0.3 percent globally. ""We should stay committed to openness and cooperation and uphold the multilateral trading system,"" Xi said, stressing win-win cooperation to promote inclusive global development. China is taking solid steps to advance opening-up in the service sector, expand financial opening-up and accelerate the opening-up process of sectors including telecommunications, education, medical treatment and culture. Last month, the first China International Import Expo (CIIE) was successfully held, which was warmly received by the international community. The CIIE will be held annually as a way to further open China's market. China's imported goods and services are estimated to exceed 30 trillion U.S. dollars and 10 trillion U.S. dollars respectively in the next 15 years. China has also taken efforts to foster a world-class business environment, and promote international cooperation at multilateral and bilateral levels. In the latest World Bank Doing Business report, China moved up 32 places in the ease of doing business ranking from last year. According to Xi, China hopes that all countries will work together for a free, open, inclusive and orderly international economic environment. Liang Ming, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, said Dec. 1 was ""an important day"" for China and the United States, as the two countries made ""the first step"" in the past few months towards a healthy relationship. ""China and the United States share huge potential in trade. Currently, China is the United States' third largest export market. It could become United States' largest export market if trade potential in farm produce and energy are fully released,"" Liang said. He said that the important consensus reached by the two heads of state could help stabilize the global financial market, which had been rattled by the past disputes. If upcoming talks could yield positive results, that would help reverse the slowing trend of world economic growth and global trade. IMF chief Christine Lagarde on Saturday said there was ""an urgent need"" to de-escalate trade tensions, reverse recent tariff increases and modernize the rules-based multilateral trade system. In a statement issued at the conclusion of the G20 Summit, Lagarde reiterated her staunch opposition to trade barriers. ""Pressures on emerging markets have been rising and trade tensions have begun to have a negative impact, increasing downside risks."" The IMF estimated that, if recently raised and threatened tariffs were to remain in place and announced tariffs were implemented, about 0.75 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) could be lost by 2020. If, instead, trade restrictions in services were reduced by 15 percent, global GDP could be 0.5 percent higher. ""We are all living at an important historical moment; an historical moment in which decisions by leaders of the world's two largest economies will determine the trajectory of the 21st century,"" said AmCham China Chairman William Zarit, hoping for a healthier and more sustainable U.S.-China trade relationship. According to Wang, the two presidents agreed that the two countries ""can and should"" ensure success of China-U.S. relations and that coordination, cooperation and stability should be the defining features of bilateral relations. In the eyes of Liang Ming, the upcoming negotiation leaves room for the two countries to put an end to the trade frictions by stopping imposing additional tariffs and annulling tariffs already imposed. ""The December 1 meeting is not the end of the story. It is a new start,"" he said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving that marks the official start of the U.S. holiday shopping season, pulled in 6.22 billion U.S. dollars in online sales this year, up 23.6 percent from a year ago and setting a new high, according to Adobe Analytics, which tracks transactions for 80 of the top 100 internet retailers in the United States, including Walmart and Amazon. However, it does not mean traditional retailers have lost their appeal. Buy online and pick up in stores grew to be a popular option for shoppers this holiday season, with ""click-and-collect"" orders increasing 73 percent from Thursday to Friday, according to Adobe. While online sales made inroads, retail malls were still packed though definitely not mobbed. More than 164 million Americans are expected to shop over the five days from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, projected the National Retail Federation. South Coast Plaza, the largest shopping mall on the West Coast of the United States, predicted that nearly 200,000 people would have visited the center, who set a record of the county in sales of over 1.5 billion U.S. dollars last year and is seeing a new record in 2018. The largest shopping center in California, anchored by three Macy's stores, Sears, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's, and Saks Fifth Avenue, is located in city of Costa Mesa, 77 km east of Los Angeles downtown. ""Today was the busiest day after Thanksgiving in South Coast Plaza's history,"" Debra Gunn Downing, spokeswoman for South Coast Plaza, told Xinhua on Friday. ""Some shoppers came for the Black Friday promotions while others came to enjoy the holiday atmosphere. There were lines outside the doors of some boutiques, including Chanel."" ""All told, nearly 200,000 people will have visited the center today. We anticipate that to continue through the weekend and the momentum to carry through the holiday season,"" she added. Black Friday, which was once relegated to the day right after Thanksgiving, now gets longer as stores offer pre-Black Friday and pre-pre-Black Friday sales. South Coast Plaza opened its holiday season last week, lighting three 90-foot-high Christmas trees and setting a Santa's Village indoor where shoppers take photos with Santa Claus in live holiday music. Amazon also offers a ""Black Friday Deals Week,"" with different markdowns each day. WORRYING FOR POTENTIAL PRICE HIKE Total spend for Black Friday weekend is predicted to reach roughly 59.6 billion U.S. dollars, according to estimates by GlobalData Retail. That represents an increase of 5.7 percent over the 2017 sales. ""More people have already shopped than at this point last year, and their average spend is higher,"" said Neil Saunders, the firm's managing director, said in a statement. One factor driving this year's shopping spree might be concerns over potential price hike against the backdrop of U.S. tariffs battles with its major trading partners. ""More worryingly, this holiday season is likely only to be the start of higher prices for shoppers,"" wrote Erin Dunne in an opinion carried by www.washingtonexaminer.com. In a rustling shopping mall in Queens, New York, 30-year-old Soraya and her husband were busy checking off items from their shopping list: clothes, sneakers, video games and a laptop. Soraya told Xinhua she might even consider buying more goods this year to avoid higher prices. According to a recent survey by Harris Insights & Analytics, a market research firm, 44 percent of U.S. consumers said they would compare prices of products more closely during the shopping season. ""It can affect your bottom line for sure,"" Lisa Jones, who was shopping Wednesday at a Home Depot store in San Mateo city, northern California, told Xinhua. She was worried that price increases would cost her more in the coming years. ""I haven't seen the prices go up yet, but I think it will happen,"" she said. Ruben, a shopper in Houston, told Xinhua he would shift some high-end electronics from his Christmas list. ""I normally wait until mid-December, but I am afraid that products in December will include the new imposed tariffs,"" he said. Peifan Yu, a Houston resident, said he would not be waiting to see lower price after Christmas as usual. Puneet Manchanda, professor of marketing at University of Michigan, told Xinhua on Wednesday that most U.S. retailers had not increased prices, but people would see that happen early in the new year. ""There is strong evidence that companies are changing their behavior vis-a-vis tariff implementation - they are stocking up heavily on the affected commodities and rationalizing their purchasing for next year,"" he said. Alex Boehnke, spokesman for the Ohio Council of Retail Merchants, said in a report that the household impact would really be seen in January or February, when retailers have to restock shelves after the holiday shopping season. Sunny Zhang, associate professor of Marketing at the Cameron School of Business, University of St. Thomas in Houston, noted that ""for made-to-order items, for example, custom-made furniture, retailers are playing the effects of tariffs as they put the pressure on consumers on immediate purchases."" var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The following is the full text of the speech: Jointly Charting a Course Toward a Brighter Future Keynote Speech by H.E. Xi Jinping President of the People's Republic of China At the APEC CEO Summit Port Moresby, 17 November 2018 Honorable Prime Minister Peter O'Neill, Chairman Isikeli Taureka, Members of the business community, Ladies and gentlemen, Good Morning! It gives me great pleasure to come to the picturesque city of Port Moresby and meet with you on board Pacific Explorer. As we brave the rough waters of the global economy and confront the many risks and challenges, it is all too befitting that we have come together on this ship to chart the course for future development and cooperation. The theme of this CEO Summit, ""Inclusion in the Age of Disruption: Charting a Common Future"", couldn't be more important. The world today is going through major development, transformation and change. While economic globalization surges forward, global growth is shadowed by protectionism and unilateralism. A new revolution in science, technology and industry is in the making; but old driving forces are yet to be replaced by new ones. The international landscape is undergoing profound changes, but imbalance in development is yet to be addressed. The reform of the global governance system is gathering momentum, but improving its efficiency remains a major challenge. The changes we are encountering in the world are unseen in a century. Changes create opportunities, but more often than not, they are accompanied by risks and challenges. Mankind has once again reached a crossroads. Which direction should we choose? Cooperation or confrontation? Openness or closing one's door? Win-win progress or a zero-sum game? The interests of all countries and indeed, the future of mankind hinge on the choice we make. A review of the world's modern history clearly shows that different choices would lead the world onto different paths. In the Asia-Pacific, the establishment of APEC is such a success story. Its birth and growth echoed the historical trend of openness and integration, our region's fervent desire for development and our people's need to meet challenges through cooperation. Openness and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific has not only boosted its prosperity but also injected vitality into the vast ocean of global economy. Today's Asia-Pacific has the world's most dynamic and promising economy, which is recognized as a key engine driving global growth. However, not all that happened in the past are success stories. Mankind has learned lessons the hard way. World War II, for instance, plunged mankind into the abyss of calamity in the last century. Not far away from where we are meeting now are the sites of the fierce Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Guadalcanal in World War II. Today, this part of the ocean has long restored its peace and calm, but never should we forget the lessons of history. An ancient Chinese philosopher observed that one needs to clean the mirror before taking a look at himself and that one should learn the lessons of the past before making decisions of the day. In reviewing history, we should draw its lessons to prevent the recurrence of past tragedies. Facing the surging historical trend, we need to ask ourselves: How can we steer the right course for global economic development? How can the international community find an effective way of conducting global governance? I believe it is imperative that we keep the following focuses: First, we should focus on openness to create more space for development. Economic globalization is the sure way for the human society to achieve development, and the multilateral trading system has created opportunities for us all. In today's world, countries' interests are so closely intertwined, and the global supply chain, industrial chain and value chain are so closely connected. We are all links of the global chain of cooperation; increasingly, we are becoming one and same community with shared interests and a shared future. This is the working of the laws of economics, a fact no one can change. We need to gain a keen appreciation of this underlying trend of our times and view the changing world for what it is and, on that basis, respond to new developments and meet new challenges in a responsible and rules-based way. Attempts to erect barriers and cut the close economic ties among countries work against the laws of economics and the trend of history and run counter to the shared desire of people around the world. This is a short-sighted approach and it is doomed to failure. Each era faces problems of its day. Problems themselves are not to be afraid of; what truly matters is for us to take a right approach to resolve the problems. Resorting to old practices such as protectionism and unilateralism will not resolve problems. On the contrary, they can only add uncertainties to the global economy. Only openness and cooperation can bring more opportunities and create more space for development. This is a well proven historical fact. One who chooses to close his door will only cut himself off from the rest of the world and lose his direction. APEC is a pioneer in building an open global economy. As the Bogor Goals are set for 2020, we should set our sights on post-2020 cooperation and endeavor to build a free trade area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP). We should say no to protectionism and unilateralism, uphold the WTO-centered multilateral trading system, make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all, and expand converging interests and share opportunities through opening-up and cooperation. Second, we should focus on development to deliver more benefits to our peoples. More than anything else, we should strive to deliver better lives to our people. Every country is entitled to an equal right to development; and no one has the right or the power to stop people in developing countries from pursuing a better life. We should strengthen development cooperation and help developing countries eliminate poverty so that people in all countries will live better lives. This is what fairness is essentially about; it is also a moral responsibility of the international community. We should make the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development a part of our national development strategies, promote coordinated advances in the economic, social and environmental fields, pursue inclusive development in keeping with our respective national conditions, and forge equal and balanced global development partnerships. Developed countries should honor their commitments on official development assistance and increase support to developing countries. We should give priority to development in international economic policy coordination and have a clear focus on development when adopting policies and rules on trade and investment, IPR protection, the digital economy and other areas. By doing so, we can create more opportunities and a more enabling environment for the development of all countries as well as robust drivers and a stable environment for global growth. The principle of ""special and differential treatment"", which is a cornerstone of the WTO, is not to be challenged. Otherwise the very foundation of the multilateral trading system will be shaken. Third, we should focus on inclusiveness and promote interactions. We live on the same planet. It is home to more than 200 countries and regions, 2,500-plus ethnic groups and over 7 billion people. Trying to erase their differences will not work. Such differences are not a hindrance to exchanges, still less a cause for confrontation. Diversity and interaction between different civilizations, social systems and paths can provide strong impetus for human progress. We should reject arrogance and prejudice, be respectful of and inclusive toward others, and embrace the diversity of our world. We should seek common ground while putting aside differences, draw upon each other's strengths and pursue co-existence in harmony and win-win cooperation. When it comes to choosing a development path for a country, no one is in a better position to make the decision than the people of that country. Just as one does not expect a single prescription to cure all diseases, one should not expect a particular model of development to fit all countries. Blindly copying the development model of others will only be counterproductive, so will be any attempt to impose one's own development model on others. Fourth, we should focus on innovation to tap new sources of growth. Breakthroughs are being made one after another in frontier areas such as information technology, life sciences, smart manufacturing and green energy, and new materials, new products and new business forms are replacing existing ones at a faster pace. Big data, 3D printing and artificial intelligence, which we read about only in science fiction in the past, are now part of our daily life. The future is already with us. In a boat race, those who row the hardest will win. If we do not move proactively to adapt to the surging tide of new scientific revolution and industrial transformation, we risk missing valuable opportunities or even falling behind the times. What we should do is to lose no time in making every effort to explore new growth drivers and development paths, and remove all institutional obstacles holding back innovation. We should boost innovation and market vitality and deepen international exchanges and cooperation on innovation so as to better meet our respective and common challenges in development. The sweeping new scientific revolution and industrial transformation will have a profound impact on the mode of production, way of life and values of human society. The need to strike a balance between equity and efficiency, capital and labor, technology and employment has become a common challenge for the international community. If not handled properly, this issue will further widen the wealth gap between the North and the South. We should gain a keen understanding of the complex dimensions of this issue and make the right decision. This will enable us to steer the new scientific revolution and industrial transformation in the right direction. Scientific and technological innovations should meet people's needs. Every country is entitled to benefit from such innovations made through both their own efforts and international cooperation. Scientific and technological innovations should not be locked up or become profit-making tools for just a few. The IPR regime is designed to protect and encourage innovation, not to create or widen the scientific and technological divide. We should develop policy institutions and systems that are responsive to the new scientific revolution and industrial transformation, and foster an enabling environment for international cooperation that will deliver the fruits of innovation to more countries and peoples. Fifth, we should focus on a rules-based approach to improve global governance. With the painful lessons of two world wars in mind, countries established the global governance framework underpinned by the United Nations and composed of the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO and other institutions. This framework, while not an ideal one, represents an important step in human history. Indeed, it has been pivotal to global peace and development in the past decades. We must strengthen rules-based global governance if we are to achieve stability and development. Rules should be formulated by the international community, not in a might-is-right way. Once the rules are made, they should not be followed or bent as one sees fit, and they should not be applied with double standards for selfish agendas. For the system of global economic governance to be equitable and efficient, it must keep up with the times. We should advance the reform of the global governance system on the principle of conducting consultation and collaboration for shared benefits. This reform should be advanced on the basis of equality, openness, transparency and inclusiveness. Developing countries should have more say and greater representation in this process. Disagreements should be resolved through consultation. Attempts to form exclusive blocs or impose one's will on others should be rejected. History has shown that confrontation, whether in the form of a cold war, a hot war or a trade war, will produce no winners. We believe that there exist no issues that countries cannot resolve through consultation as long as they handle these issues in a spirit of equality, mutual understanding and accommodation. Ladies and gentlemen, Friends, In 1978, China embarked on the great journey of reform and opening-up. Over the past 40 years, the Chinese people, with vision, hard work and perseverance, have forged ahead and taken a historic stride. We have stood up, become prosperous and grown in strength. We the Chinese nation are moving forward toward great rejuvenation. -- Over the past 40 years, the Chinese people have blazed a new trail and made solid progress. With enterprise and grit and through self-reliance, we have turned China into the world's second biggest economy, making tremendous advances in our country's development and the improvement of people's lives. It is the relentless efforts of the Chinese people that have made China what it is today! -- Over the past 40 years, the Chinese people have embraced the world with open arms. China has pursued its development through opening-up. As a result, China's import and export of goods have grown by 198 times and those of services by over 147 times. China has attracted more than US$2 trillion in foreign investment. It has become the world's biggest trader of goods, the biggest tourism market and a major trading partner with over 130 countries. -- Over the past 40 years, the Chinese people have pursued development with a single focus and made lives better for ourselves. Guided by a people-centered development philosophy, between 1978 and 2017 China raised its per capita disposable income by 22.8 times, lifted 740 million people out of poverty and doubled the number of jobs created. We have achieved free compulsory primary and middle-school education nationwide and established the world's biggest social safety net. Thanks to these accomplishments, our people now feel more secure and have a greater sense of fulfillment and contentment. -- Over the past 40 years, the Chinese people have pursued our own development to achieve development for all. China has stayed on the path of peaceful development, got actively involved in global economic governance, and actively supported other developing countries in their development. We have implemented responsible macroeconomic policies and contributed a significant share of global growth. We have played our part in responding to the Asian financial crisis and the global financial crisis. By so doing, China has contributed its vision and input to building a community with a shared future for mankind. Five years ago, I announced the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which aims to enhance connectivity among countries and regions, promote interconnected development, and create new space for global growth. This initiative has won wide international endorsement in the past five years. China has signed BRI cooperation documents with over 140 countries and international organizations, and a large number of cooperation projects have been launched under this Initiative. Let me make this clear: the BRI is an open platform for cooperation. It is guided by the principle of consultation and collaboration for shared benefits. It is not designed to serve any hidden geopolitical agenda, it is not targeted against anyone and it does not exclude anyone. It is not an exclusive club that is closed to non-members, nor is it a ""trap"" as some people have labeled it. Rather, the BRI is a major and transparent initiative with which China shares opportunities and pursues common development with the rest of the world. In April next year, China will host the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing, and we welcome members of the Asia-Pacific business community to this event. As we look back over the four decades of reform and opening-up, we in China are more convinced than ever before that only through reform and opening-up can China develop itself. Going forward, China will take an even more responsible approach, be even more open and inclusive, and strive to achieve even higher quality of growth. By doing so, as it develops itself, China will make greater contributions to the common prosperity of the world. China will continue to significantly expand market access, strengthen IPR protection, and do more to increase imports. Since the beginning of this year, China has announced a host of new measures for further opening-up, which include the following: creating a more attractive investment and business environment, significantly lowering the tariffs for 1,449 consumer goods and 1,585 industrial goods, further cutting the tariffs for automobiles and auto parts to 13.8 percent and 6 percent respectively, and eliminating tariffs on all imported anti-cancer drugs. With a new round of tariff cuts coming into effect on 1 November, China's overall tariff rates have been reduced to 7.5 percent, lower than the majority of developing countries and beyond the commitment China made upon its accession to the WTO. China has released a new negative list on foreign investment, and will further open up finance, automobiles, aircraft, ships and other sectors. According to a recent World Bank report, China has moved up over 30 places in the ease of doing business ranking over the past year and is among the economies with the most significant improvement. China views all companies, both Chinese and foreign, as equals. China welcomes and encourages fair competition among them, and will fully protect their legitimate rights and interests. A week ago, the first China International Import Expo (CIIE) was successfully held in Shanghai. It was attended by 172 countries, regions and international organizations, over 3,600 companies, and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals worth US$57.8 billion were sealed. The Hongqiao International Economic and Trade Forum, held as part of the Expo, attracted over 4,500 leading personalities from various sectors around the world. With such actual steps, China has demonstrated its commitment to trade liberalization and opening-up of its market. I wish to welcome you all to the second CIIE to be held next year. I am confident that the large market of China, with a population of close to 1.4 billion, will be a source of dynamic growth for the global economy. Many of you present today have witnessed, contributed to and benefited from China's reform and opening-up, and have forged a special bond with China. The business community is an important force driving the economic development of the Asia-Pacific and the wider world. As entrepreneurs, you should bring out your best and ride the waves of economic globalization. I hope you will continue to share your insights with decision makers, encourage countries to adopt positive and practical policies and carry out extensive economic and technological cooperation. Together, we can open a new horizon for the common development and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific and the world at large. Ladies and gentlemen, Dear friends, We APEC member economies are brought together by the Pacific Ocean. I was looking at the vast ocean when I boarded the ship, and it struck me that we are all indeed fellow passengers in the same boat. Let us keep the steering wheel steady and paddle in the right direction so that the ship of the global economy will brave winds, break waves and sail to a brighter future. Thank you! var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"
10,http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2018/1115/c90000-9518572.html,Full text of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang's speech at the 44th Singapore Lecture,"November 15, 2018","SINGAPORE, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Tuesday delivered the 44th Singapore Lecture organized by ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in collaboration with Business China. The following is the full text of the speech: Pursuing Open and Integrated Development For Shared Prosperity The 44th Singapore Lecture By H.E. Li Keqiang Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China Singapore, 13 November 2018 Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends, It gives me great pleasure to deliver the 44th Singapore Lecture organized by ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in collaboration with Business China and communicate with all of you on this occasion. I wish to first express my appreciation to the two institutions for their long and productive efforts to promote r engagement and better understanding between China and Singapore. Let me also use this opportunity to extend, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, warm greetings to the distinguished audience today and through you, to the Singaporean people. China-Singapore relations have been making steady progress with deepening practical cooperation. During President Xi Jinping's state visit to Singapore in 2015, our two countries established an all-round cooperative partnership progressing with the times. The purpose of my visit this time is to work with Singaporean colleagues to review past progress, further build consensus and deepen cooperation in order to lift our relations to a higher level. China and Singapore are neighbors linked by the sea, and our peoples are bonded with a special affinity. I still recall my visit to Singapore back in 1985 when I felt deeply impressed by Singapore's vibrant economy, magnificent skyline, orderly society and efficient governance. More than thirty years on, I see new progress and a country bustling with new energy. Over the past five decades and more since independence, Singapore has made remarkable achievements, becoming the world's important economic and financial center, shipping hub, petrochemical and electronics manufacturing center and a R&D center of biotechnology. It now occupies a leading position in the world in terms of development level, innovation capacity and competitiveness. I wish to hereby express my sincere congratulations on Singapore's tremendous accomplishments. Singapore's success story has been underpinned by an abiding commitment to openness and vigorous efforts to develop an open economy in keeping with the trend of economic globalization. China's progress in the past four decades has also been powered by ever wider opening-up. The decision to integrate itself into the world economy and share opportunities and benefits in the process of opening-up has not only propelled China's own progress but also contributed to world development. The course of development of our countries thus shows that pursuing open and integrated development is a sure path leading to prosperity and inclusive growth for countries regardless of size. It is also the reason for the unprecedented and sustained growth of the post-war global economy. We live in a world of extensive, profound and complex changes. Continued momentum of recovery coupled with the emergence of troubling risks and challenges has brought the global economy again to a crossroads. Economic globalization is facing a backlash, protectionism and unilateralism are on the rise and global trade tensions are gathering. These developments have eroded global economic and trade growth, and dampened confidence in the prospect of future development. At the same time, the new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation on the back of economic globalization have created new opportunities for global growth, yet they are also handicapped by a lack of inclusiveness, as reflected in the uneven distribution of opportunities and benefits and hard-hit traditional industries and jobs. Facing these risks and challenges, we in the international community must decide where we should go and how we should respond. The right decision can only be made with a proper understanding and evaluation of the realities. An objective fact that any fair-minded person would recognize is that economic globalization, by enabling freer flow of goods, capital, people and information, has delivered producers bigger markets, consumers more choices, and countries broader space for development. Moreover, every leap in global productivity and human civilization in the past was driven by technological revolution and industrial transformation. At a time when the traditional drivers of growth are losing steam, the new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation would be critical for sustained, steady growth of the world economy. Just as every coin has two sides, economic globalization and the new technological revolution and industrial transformation also have their upsides and downsides. Yet compared with the compelling benefits they bring, the problems and imbalances are but side effects that can be tackled with effective responses. What would be inadvisable is to allow the bigger gains to be undermined, or to quote a Chinese idiom, give up eating for fear of choking. Such a line of reasoning would help us draw a logical conclusion and make the right decision. The rules-based multilateral trading system is the cornerstone of economic globalization and the international economic and trade order. Its authority and efficacy should be respected and upheld. Admittedly, the WTO rules do fall short in some respects, which ought to be brought up to date by reforms. China has all along been positive toward the reform. That said, the reform should be guided by some basic principles: the overall direction of trade liberalization should not change; the basic principles of openness, transparency, inclusiveness and non-discrimination should not change; and no attempts should be made to dismantle the current system or build a new one. Such attempts would weaken the foundations of the multilateral trading system and destabilize global trade. As the reform involves the interests of all parties, there should be equal participation, with the concerns of the majority WTO members accommodated and the broadest possible common ground pursued. In particular, the development rights and interests of all developing members must be upheld in order to narrow, rather than widen, the North-South gap. The intricacy of the reform determines that a package solution that fixes all problems at the same time would be unrealistic. Instead, prioritization should be sorted out so that the most pressing issues such as the selection of new members to the Appellate Body will be addressed first. Free and fair trade are two major concepts in the multilateral trading system. China advocates free trade, which is the foundation and prerequisite of trade. At the same time, China has all along pursued equity and fairness in trade with concrete actions, as we believe trade that is inequitable or unfair would not be sustainable. The equitable and fair trade China stands for is one underpinned by the WTO principles of multilateralism, inclusiveness and non-discrimination. What we oppose is the practice of imposing unilateral rules or engaging in protectionism in the guise of fair trade. Specific issues concerning fair trade should be tackled in the broader context of free trade. Only in this way can the reform of the WTO move forward along the right track and can the world economy grow further through openness, exchanges and integration. History tells us that humanity has the wisdom and means needed to tackle all kinds of risks and challenges. No obstacles would be insurmountable when we join hands and work together like we did during the global financial crisis. I have strong confidence and expectation that this togetherness will tide us over any difficulty and usher in a bright future for the world economy. Ladies and Gentlemen, Our region East Asia, home to such economies as ASEAN, China, Japan and the ROK, has a combined population of 2.2 billion, and takes up over one fourth of both the global economic output and trade. Our fast-growing and dynamic region has been an important engine of global growth, thanks to the ever-widening intra-regional openness and cooperation. In the past 20-plus years, intra-regional trade has taken up an increasing share in the overall trade of ASEAN, China, Japan and the ROK, and reached nearly 50% today. Intra-regional investment has surged, so has the number of visits exchanged among regional countries. All these have given a strong boost to the economic growth and living standards in this region. East Asian cooperation enjoys unique advantages, a solid foundation and bright prospects. Geographic proximity and similar cultures have nurtured a long-standing friendship among us. The different stages of development, resource endowments and industrial structures have made us highly complementary and deeply integrated in the industrial and value chains and increased the potential of our cooperation. To fully unlock this potential, we must go with the trend of economic globalization and make more institutional arrangements for regional trade and investment liberalization and facilitation. At the summits on East Asian cooperation last year, we all agreed to pursue opening-up and cooperation at a higher level and work toward an early establishment of an East Asia Economic Community. This is a long-term, comprehensive undertaking that requires sustained, step-by-step efforts. We could use the Belt and Road Initiative as an opportunity to enhance connectivity and advance big project cooperation. We must fully leverage the existing regional cooperation frameworks, accelerate the upgrading of existing FTAs or sign new ones, and expand industrial capacity cooperation and third-market cooperation. The RCEP covers nearly half of the world's population and to one third of global trade. Its conclusion on the basis of WTO rules will contribute to regional integration. This year has seen substantial progress in RCEP negotiations. China will continue to follow a win-win and flexible approach and work with other parties to advance negotiations. We hope all parties will make concerted efforts toward concluding the negotiations in 2019, with a view to securing a modern, comprehensive, high-standard and mutually beneficial agreement. We also need to strengthen cooperation on health, education, culture, tourism and poverty reduction, and expand people-to-people and subnational exchanges to strengthen the bond between our peoples. East Asian cooperation cannot thrive without a peaceful and stable environment, which requires the efforts of all parties. We need to pursue common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, deepen mutual political trust, respect and accommodate each other's legitimate security concerns, and address differences and disagreements through dialogue and consultation. The South China Sea has seen greater stability and easing of the situation. China is ready to work with ASEAN countries to fully and effectively implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), deepen practical maritime cooperation, and strive to conclude consultations on a code of conduct (COC) in the South China Sea in three years' time on the basis of consensus. This will go a long way to advancing regional peace and development. The Chinese nation loves peace and upholds justice. We believe in harmony in diversity and amity with one's neighbors. China will unwaveringly pursue peaceful development and will never impose its will on others. No matter how developed it may become, China will never seek hegemony or expansion. We will continue to follow the policy of building friendships and partnerships with all neighbors in keeping with the principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness. We will endeavor to be a trustworthy and reliable partner for regional countries. Ladies and Gentlemen, This year marks the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening-up. In the past four decades, China has achieved tremendous progress in its development and transformative changes in the country. China's GDP registered an average annual growth of 9.5%, which made our country the second largest economy in the world. People's lives have significantly improved from shortage and poverty to abundance and moderate prosperity. More than 700 million people have been lifted out of poverty. Those of you who are regular visitors of China may have personally witnessed such changes. China's development has not just benefited its own people but the whole world. In recent years, it has contributed over 30% to global growth and 70% to that of East Asia. What is the fundamental reason for China's fast development over the years? In the final analysis, it has been down to the hard work and perseverance of the Chinese people in the face of difficulties and hardships. The Chinese nation is known for its industry, wisdom and fortitude. We have made continuous efforts to deepen reform, free up prices and the market overall, and remove institutional barriers and unreasonable restrictions, thus unlocking people's entrepreneurship, creativity and drive for innovation. In recent years, we have advanced the reform of streamlining administration and delegating powers, and adopted a prudent yet accommodative regulatory approach. As a result, the number of market entities has seen exponential growth, to the tune of more than 100 million today. Emerging industries have flourished, and traditional industries are being transformed at a faster pace. A powerful new driving force has thus been created for the sustained and sound growth in our country. Another factor contributing to China's achievements has been opening-up, which has helped China to leverage its comparative advantages and raise its competitiveness and development level by integrating it into the global division of labor and industrial and value chains. In this process, we have also endured huge pressure, paid a high price, and experienced growing pains. Some obligations China assumed upon WTO accession far exceeded what was required of a developing country and even approached the level of a developed member. For example, China undertook to cut tariffs for agricultural products to around 15%, only one quarter of the world's average level and lower than that of many advanced economies. Some industries in China were inevitably affected in the open marketplace, leading to bankruptcies and lay-offs. In some sectors, domestic brands came to be outnumbered by foreign ones, such as in passenger vehicles. Yet, we view these developments with an open mind and from a win-win perspective. We value good faith. To date, we have delivered on all our WTO commitments and even outperformed some of them by taking voluntary measures of opening-up, including making multiple rounds of tariff cuts that have brought our average tariff level down to 7.5%. Between 2001 and 2017, China's import of goods and services reached US$20 trillion and US$3.7 trillion respectively with annual growth rates of 13.5% and 16.7%, 6.9 and 8.8 percentage points higher than the world average. This year, import of both goods and services has seen double-digit increase. In its pursuit of greater opening-up, China has made important contributions to global economic and trade growth. Some foreign friends may wonder whether China remains a developing country now that it is the second largest economy in the world. To understand a country as large and populous as China and to determine its development stage, one needs to take a comprehensive and multi-dimensional view and put things in perspective. Yes, China has a big economic aggregate. Yet its per capita GDP is merely about 80% of the world average and less than one sixth that of Singapore. Yes, China is seeing fast growth in new industries and new forms and models of business. Yet its traditional industries, still a considerable share of the economy, urgently need transformation and upgrading. Hence China's overall industrial development remains at a medium-low level in the global context. Yes, some Chinese cities may seem modern and the coastal areas fairly advanced. Yet there are significant disparities in development between rural and urban areas and among different regions. Primitive infrastructure remains a big challenge for many places in China's rural areas and some remote regions, where access to roads, electricity and the internet has only just been provided. China has nearly 600 million people living in the rural areas and more than 200 million migrant workers, who live and work under conditions far below what is available to urban residents. Our estimate at the end of last year put the number of rural residents with a per capita annual income of less than 3,000 RMB yuan at over 30 million. Furthermore, China lags far behind developed countries in education, elderly and medical care and health. All these realities speak to the fact that China remains a developing country, and there is still a long way to go before China achieves modernization. China has come this far thanks to reform and opening-up, which will continue to serve as a key driver for development. Yet still there has been no shortage of doubts and misgivings about China's commitment to reform and opening-up. As I see it, such concerns are unnecessary. Why should China take a pause, slow down the pace, or even backpedal in its reforms when reform and opening-up has brought such tremendous changes and benefits to our country and its people? Reform and opening-up enjoys broad public support as it represents the will of the people. It is the default option for China in pursuing greater progress. Our reforms will only intensify and our door will only open wider to the world. China is committed to market-oriented economic reform. We will work to remove institutional obstacles and see that the market plays a decisive role in resources allocation and the government better fulfills its responsibilities. Putting the concerns of people and businesses at the front and center of its agenda, the Chinese government will continue to streamline administrative approval procedures, exercise fair and impartial regulation and provide more efficient services. We will strengthen protection of property rights and abolish all regulations and practices that impede the development of a unified market and a level playing field in order to further improve the business environment. The reform to transform state-owned enterprises (SOEs) into standard companies and joint-stock companies has been basically completed. It is entirely up to the SOEs themselves to make business decisions and take responsibility for any profits or losses. Those that perform poorly will be put out of business or d down. In our laws and regulations, there is no provision on subsidies or special policies that favor SOEs. Continued efforts will be made to deepen the reform of SOEs and state-owned assets, including mixed ownership reform in an active and prudent manner. Foreign investors are welcome to participate in the reform and restructuring of Chinese SOEs. The private sector, an important part of the Chinese economy, will receive greater support. And targeted measures will be taken to ease their difficulties in accessing affordable financing. China's industrial policy, which is transparent and in line with international rules, provides fair and equal treatment to enterprises of all types of ownerships. China is committed to building an open economy at a higher level. We will further ease restrictions on market access, shorten the negative list for foreign investment, and accelerate the opening of financial and other modern services sectors. To break new ground in opening-up, we will continue to improve the quality of pilot free trade zones and explore the development of free trade ports, to foster new highlights in our opening-up endeavors. We will take more active steps to lower tariffs and facilitate customs clearance to expand import of quality goods and services. The first China International Import Expo concluded a few days ago was an earnest initiative to open China's market to the rest of the world and a solid step to support free trade. A total of 172 countries, regions and international organizations and more than 3,600 enterprises participated in the event, attracting more than 400,000 domestic and overseas buyers. The Expo saw booming sales and deals worth US$57.83 billion reached for intended purchase of goods and services within a year. The recent fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate have prompted some discussions and concerns. Persistent depreciation of the RMB will only do more harm than good to China. Therefore we will not engage in competitive devaluation. Instead, we will work to create conditions for keeping the value of the yuan stable. Given the healthy fundamentals of the Chinese economy, the sound balance of international payments and abundant foreign exchange reserves, there is no basis for persistent depreciation of the RMB. There is every reason that the RMB exchange rate will remain basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level. Stringent IPR protection is crucial for all companies, Chinese and foreign-invested alike. It also serves China's own needs for high-quality development. We will align our innovation protection system with international business rules, further improve IPR-related laws and regulations, strengthen law enforcement, handle IPR cases more efficiently, and introduce a more rigorous mechanism of punitive compensation for IPR infringements to deter violations. The Chinese government will never allow forced technology transfer or make technology transfer a precondition for the approval of foreign-invested projects. Innovation can only be self-sustaining and its value fully realized when the outcomes are successfully commercialized. More innovative businesses from around the world are welcome to pursue business success in the Chinese market, which provides a broad stage for innovation application. Ladies and Gentlemen, China-Singapore friendly relations and cooperation have come a long way in the past forty years. Looking ahead, China is ready to join hands with Singapore to advance the development of the Belt and Road and build the three cooperation platforms of connectivity, financial support and third party cooperation. Let's make the pie of our trade and economic cooperation bigger, expand innovation cooperation and work to upgrade China-ASEAN cooperation. Continued progress in the China-Singapore all-round cooperative partnership progressing with the times will bring more benefits to our peoples and make new contributions to peace, stability and prosperity of Asia and the world. Thank you. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

[Photo by Gao Erqiang/China Daily] Overseas retailers racked up big sales on Alibabaâs Singles Day shopping festival. The e-commerce giant said 3,700 categories representing 180,000 overseas brands from 75 countries and regions were featured during the shopping extravaganza. âDouble Eleven is a feast for global consumers, and Chinese consumersâ demand for overseas goods is increasing rapidly, so global merchants are actively participating,â said Wei Chen, deputy general manager of Tmall International, Alibabaâs online retailer. The ongoing trade dispute with China did not deter US merchants from participating, with more than 10,000 of those brands hailing from the United States. The US ranked second, after Japan, in gross merchandise volume among countries and regions selling to China. William Zhao, head of Asia markets at Tmallâs Import &Export Department, said maternal and childrenâs products and cosmetics and electronics made in Japan were the best-selling imports on Tmall on Singles Day. âJapanese merchants dominated not just Singles Day but also our sales over the year. They achieved the largest scale since 2017 and are still growing at a tremendous speed,â Zhao said. Many US brands joined this yearâs festival for the first time. Foot Locker Inc, one of the largest sportswear and footwear retailers in the United States, debuted its online store on Tmall. Doreen Wang, global head of BrandZ at Kantar Millward Brown, said she was not aware of any US brands changing or adjusting their strategies for Singles Day because of the tariff standoff. âItâs the biggest shopping festival in the world, and itâs a very important presentation opportunity for all brands,â said Wang, who works for the largest brand-equity database worldwide, which covers 10,000 brands across 43 countries. âDouble Eleven is far more than a promotion campaign. For brand owners, itâs more important to enhance customersâ brand experiences, to turn those consumers into loyal consumers, which is more profitable,â she said. Wang said she believes that the US brands âwill still focus on the needs of Chinese consumersâ. âIf you win in China, you win the world,â she added. While US sellers have seen good results from their participation this year, data from the festival show that US shoppers are also in the mood to buy Chinese products. Consumers from 200 countries and regions placed orders on Tmall.com, and US buyers made large contributions to those sales. Tmallâs Zhao said Japanese online sales have grown in China because a significant number of small and medium-sized companies in Japan entered the arena and competed for shares because of increasing confidence in Chinese markets. âFor example, MTG, which makes ReFa, a facial roller (a type of massager) is competing with other products from Panasonic, which used to dominate the market in China,â Zhao said, âand I have to say that their performance is quite good,â he added. Teruo Omori, team manager of MTGâs global business division in Nagoya, said he is very pleased to learn of the favorable performance of their products in China. âI have a vivid feeling that our brand is getting more recognition in China. The Chinese market is our strategic priority in the future and we are expecting more gains from it,â Omori said. Alibaba celebrated the 10th year of its â11/11â shopping gala on Sunday in Shanghai. During the 24-hour period, Alibaba sales soared past $30.8 billion, hitting another record high by breaking last yearâs total Singles Day sales of $24.22 billion, with 27 percent year-on-year growth. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

From 2001 to 2017, Chinaâs average annual growth rate of goods imports reached 13.5%, which is twice the speed of the global average. In 2017, China imported $1.84 trillion worth of goods from around the worldâ6.2 times that of 2002âin the first year after it joined the WTO. Service imports amounted to $467.6 billion in 2017, with a deficit of $239.5 billion, which is 10.1 and 798.3 times higher than 2002 figures, respectively. Now, China is the worldâs second largest importer of goods and the second largest importer of services, accounting for about a tenth of total global imports. Today, Chinaâs enormous market is in want of more quality products and services to meet the Chinese peopleâs desire for a better life. The worldâs largest middle-income group is going through an accelerating consumption upgrade that is just too big a cake for any business to ignore. According to a Ministry of Commerce report, Chinese consumers have strong demand for imported goods, and imported goods have become an important supplement to market supply. It is estimated that in the next 15 years, Chinaâs imports of goods and services will exceed $30 trillion and $10 trillion, respectively. Since the beginning of this year, China has repeatedly reduced taxes, resulting in a reduction in the total tariff level from 9.8% in the previous year to 7.5%, with an average reduction of 23%. Starting from May 1, China has exempted duties on as many as 28 medicines, including all cancer drugs, to further increase access to medicines. Starting from Jul. 1, China significantly lowered import tariffs on automobiles as well as a wide range of consumer goods. And starting from Nov. 1, China slashed most-favored-nation tariffs on a total of 1,585 taxable items. Spurred by the series of measures, the proactive expansion of imports has achieved remarkable results. According to data released by the General Administration of Customs, in the first 9 months this year, Chinaâs cumulative imports totaled 10.42 trillion yuan ($1.5 trillion), a year-on-year increase of 14.1%, which is 7.6 percentage points higher than exports. There is no doubt that the import fair will unleash the power of Chinaâs domestic demand, which has been witnessed too often in recent years. But the CIIE will be more than just a space for money and goods/services to change hands. It is a signal that bears the clear message that China is willing to open its market wider to the world and the milestone event will usher in a closer relationship between China and global businesses in the foreseeable future."

The first China International Import Expo (CIIE) will be held on Nov. 5-10 in Shanghai. (Xinhua/Li He) Over the past 40 years, China has pursued the fundamental policy of opening up, starting a great journey in which it achieved common progress with the world. To better embrace the future, China will further open up its market, expand import, and make the China International Import Expo (CIIE), the worldâs first import-themed national exhibition into a success. Statistics 1: Chinaâs annual import value rose a yearly average of 18.1 percent from 18.7 billion yuan ($ 2.7 billion) to 12.5 trillion yuan during the 40 years of reform and opening up. The first CIIE will be participated by over 3,600 enterprises, including more than 200 Fortune 500 companies and many industry leaders. More than 100 new products and technologies will debut at the event. To expand import is a long-term policy that China adheres to. Especially after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the policy has been made more explicit and helped China achieved remarkable results. From 1978 to 2017, Chinaâs annual import value rose an yearly average of 18.1 percent from 18.7 billion yuan to 12.5 trillion yuan. From 1982 to 2017, Chinaâs import of services expanded 230 times with an average annual growth of 16.8 percent. China imported a total of $1.84 trillion worth of goods in 2017, 6.2 times of those in 2002, the first year after its accession to the WTO. Its services import and deficits were respectively $467.6 billion and $239.5 billion, 10.1 and 798.3 times of those in 2002. So far, China has grown into the worldâs second largest importer of commodities and second largest importer of services, with its import of commodities and services accounting for around 10 percent of the global total. Bai Ming, deputy director of the Ministry of Commerceâs International Market Research Institute believes that well-structured import in a moderate scale will place positive effects on the improvement of Chinaâs domestic production factors supply. The expansion of import is a proactive move to meet peopleâs aspiration toward a better life, said Zhao Ping, director of the international trade research department under the Academy of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. She introduced that the overseas consumption of Chinese people was growing at a double-digit pace annually in the last decade. To expand consumption of high-quality products and service import will enrich consumption choices, promote the backflow of overseas consumption, optimize consumption structure, accelerate consumption upgrading, and satisfy peopleâs personalized, diversified and differentiated consumption demands, Zhao remarked. Statistics 2: Chinaâs growth of imports was 5.3 percentage points higher than the global average, which offered broad market and valuable opportunities of cooperation for global enterprises. An employee of the Australian health supplements company Blackmores told Peopleâs Daily that the CIIE is of profound significance for the company, calling the event a powerful move of China to support free trade and expand opening up. The CIIE would serve as a valuable platform for Blackmores to promote its brand and products in the Chinese market, the employee added. The sales volume of the company hit 143 million Australian dollars in the last fiscal year, up 22 percent from a year ago. China was the fastest-growing import market among major importers of the world in 2017. Its growth of import was respectively 8.9, 5.5 and 5.4 percentage points higher than that of the US, Germany, and Japan, and also 5.3 percentage points higher than the world average. The country offered broad market and valuable opportunities of cooperation for global enterprises. Wang Bingnan, Vice Minister of Chinaâs Ministry of Commerce noted that the CIIE is a platform where every country can negotiate major issues of economy and trade and seek for common development, so as to make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all. Statistics 3: Chinaâs overall tariff level has been lowered to 7.5 percent after rounds of adjustment. Since November 1, China further lowered tariff rates on 1,585 taxable items including stones, ceramics and machinery. The countryâs overall tariff level has been lowered to 7.5 percent after rounds of adjustment. Through a series of pragmatic measures, China showcased its firm conviction to take the initiative to expand import and further open up. Thanks to the improvement of business environment of the ports and the facilitation of cross-border trade, the overall customs clearance time for cargo will be further reduced by 1/3, from 97.39 hours in 2017 to 65 hours before the end of this year. Furthermore, the time will be reduced to 48 hours by the end of 2021, almost half of that in 2017. In addition, departments such as Chinaâs General Administration of Customs have also tailored many measures of facilitation for the CIIE. Wang said the CIIE is an announcement of China to implement a new round of opening up policies. China will steadfastly open wider to the outside world more vigorously at a higher level, to promote its own development, as well as the worldâs common development, and create more opportunities for other countries to share its development dividends. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Work Together for an Open Global Economy That is Innovative and Inclusive Keynote Speech by H.E. Xi Jinping At the Opening Ceremony of the First China International Import Expo Shanghai, 5 November 2018 Your Excellencies Heads of State and Government, Your Royal Highness, Your Excellencies Heads of International Organizations, Your Excellencies Heads of Delegations, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends, In May 2017, I announced Chinaâs decision to hold the China International Import Expo (CIIE) starting from 2018. Today, after more than one year of preparations and with the strong support from various parties, the first CIIE is officially opened. At the outset, I wish to express, on behalf of the Chinese government and people and also in my own name, warm welcome, sincere greetings and best wishes to you all. The CIIE is the worldâs first import expo held at the national level, an innovation in the history of global trade. It is an important decision made by China to pursue a new round of high-level opening-up, and is Chinaâs major initiative to still widen market access to the rest of the world. It demonstrates Chinaâs consistent position of supporting the multilateral trading system and promoting free trade. It is a concrete action by China to advance an open world economy and support economic globalization. Under the theme of âNew Era, Shared Futureâ, the CIIE will help friends from around the world to seize opportunities presented by Chinaâs development in the new era and offer a platform for us to deepen international business cooperation for shared prosperity and progress. Attending the event are 172 countries, regions and international organizations, more than 3,600 companies with a total exhibition area of 300,000 square meters, and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers who are here to explore business deals. I wish all friends participating in this Expo a most pleasant and rewarding experience. Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends, The world is going through a new round of major development, transformation and adjustment. The economic and social well-being of countries in the world is increasingly interconnected. The reform of the global governance system and the international order is picking up speed. On the other hand, the world economy is going through profound adjustment, and protectionism and unilateralism are resurging. Economic globalization faces headwinds, and multilateralism and the system of free trade are under threat. Uncertainties and instabilities still abound, and risks and challenges are growing. Living in such a complex world, we need to see the underlining trend, bolster confidence in our future through opening-up and cooperation and work together to cope with risks and challenges. People with vision in the world would agree that economic globalization, as an irreversible trend of history, has greatly boosted global growth. This is an overarching trend, something that is independent of peopleâs will. What we mankind can do is to understand, adapt to, and apply the law of history instead of trying to prevent it from happening. The wheel of history, indeed, will keep rolling forward no matter what. History tells us that openness and cooperation are a major driving force behind dynamic international economic and trade activities. The current situation calls for openness and cooperation to foster steady global recovery. Looking ahead, openness and cooperation will remain essential for continued human progress. A great vision, simple and pure, requires credible actions. Given the profound shifts in the international economic landscape, the vision for a better world for all calls on countries to act with greater courage and actively champion openness and cooperation in order to secure shared development. -- It is important for all countries to open wider and expand the space for mutually beneficial cooperation. Openness brings progress while seclusion leads to backwardness. Global trade and investment are driven by the need of countries for mutual exchange and complementarity. The history of economic cooperation and international trade testifies to the law that âeconomies make progress through exchange and inter-connectivity and fall behind because of seclusion and dnessâ. Efforts to reduce tariff barriers and open wider will lead to inter-connectivity in economic cooperation and global trade, while the practices of beggaring thy neighbor, isolation and seclusion will only result in trade stagnation and an unhealthy world economy. Countries need to pursue an open policy, explicitly oppose protectionism and unilateralism, and strive to enhance the level of opening-up at both multilateral and bilateral levels, so that we could make our economies interconnected and build an open world economy. We need to improve macroeconomic coordination and reduce the negative spillovers of national policies to jointly promote global economic growth. We need to establish a set of global economic and trade rules that is fair, reasonable and transparent, and promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation to make the global economy more open through greater exchanges and integration. -- It is important for all countries to pursue innovative growth and speed up the transformation of growth drivers. Innovation is the premier engine for development. Only with bold innovation and reform can we break the bottlenecks in global growth. The world economy has just emerged from the shadow of the international financial crisis and recovery is still unstable. There is an urgent need for concerted efforts of countries in the world to promote scientific innovation and foster new growth drivers. The well-being of humanity is the biggest driving force for scientific innovation. In our inter-connected global village, to share the fruit of innovation is the common aspiration and natural choice of the world community. We need to seize the opportunities presented by the new round of technological and industrial revolution, strengthen cooperation in frontier sectors such as digital economy, artificial intelligence and nanotechnology, and work together to foster new technologies, new industries, and new forms and models of business. -- It is important for all countries to pursue inclusive development for the benefit of all. As a Chinese saying goes, âAll flowers in full blossom make a beautiful spring.â To lead a happy life is the common aspiration of people all over the world. Progress of the human society requires continued efforts of all countries to advance opening-up, cooperation and win-win development, instead of seclusion, confrontation and monopoly. In a world of deepening economic globalization, practices of the law of the jungle and winner-takes-all only represent a dead end. Inclusive growth for all is surely the right way forward. Countries need to rise above differences and leverage their respective strengths to pursue inclusive growth in the face of common risks and challenges. We need to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, reduce the imbalances in global development, and make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all. This way, people of all countries will be able to share in the benefits of economic globalization and global growth. Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends, The last four decades of reform and opening-up in China has been an epic journey for the Chinese people. With determination and through self reliance and hard work, we have forged ahead on the road to national development and progress. China has pursued development with its door open and succeeded in transforming a d and semi-d economy into a fully open economy. Openness has become a trademark of China. China has grown by embracing the world, and the world has also benefited from Chinaâs opening-up. As I explained at the Boao Forum for Asia in April, Chinaâs economic growth over the past 40 years has been achieved with a commitment to opening-up. In the same vein, high-quality development of Chinaâs economy in the future can only be guaranteed with greater openness. I have made it clear once and again that Chinaâs door will never be d. It will only open still wider. China will not stop its effort to pursue higher-quality opening-up! China will not stop its effort to pursue an open world economy! And China will not stop its effort to pursue a community with a shared future for mankind! China will unswervingly follow a win-win strategy of opening-up, adopt high-quality policies to advance trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and move toward nationwide opening-up that coordinates the coastal and inland areas and connects the eastern and western regions. China will remain a strong advocate of openness at the global level, and will continue to act as a stable engine of global growth, a big market with enormous opportunities and an active supporter of global governance reform. To broaden its opening-up, China will step up efforts in the following aspects: First, we will stimulate the potential for increased imports. Chinaâs initiative to expand imports is not a choice of expediency. It is a future-oriented step taken to embrace the world and promote common development. To meet the trend of consumption upgrading, we will take more proactive measures to increase peopleâs income and spending power, foster new growth areas of medium-high-end consumption, continue to unleash the potential of the domestic market and expand the scope for imports. We will take further steps to lower tariffs, facilitate customs clearance, reduce institutional costs in import, and step up cross-border e-commerce and other new forms and models of business. China has a big market of over 1.3 billion people, and it is our sincere commitment to open the Chinese market. The CIIE, an event to be held on an annual basis, will feature good performance, good results and continued success in the years to come. Second, we will continue to broaden market access. The market access measures I announced in April have been basically put in place. China has shortened the negative list on foreign investment to reduce investment restrictions and promote investment liberalization. We are steadily increasing the openness of the financial sector, continuing to open up the service sector, and working toward greater openness in the agricultural, mining and manufacturing sectors. We are accelerating opening in such areas as telecommunications, education, medical service and culture. In particular, the foreign equity caps are going to be raised in the education and medical service sectors, where there is both huge interest among foreign investors and shortage in domestic supply. In the coming 15 years, Chinaâs import of goods and services are expected to exceed US$30 trillion and US$10 trillion respectively. Third, we will foster a world-class business environment. China will introduce the law on foreign investment at a faster pace, and institute an open and transparent system of foreign-related laws. We will implement, across the board, the management system based on pre-establishment national treatment and negative list. We respect international business rules and practice, and provide equal treatment to all types of businesses registered in China. We protect the lawful rights and interests of foreign companies, and are resolute in meting out, in a law-binding manner, punishment for violations of the lawful rights and interests of foreign investors, particularly IPR infringements. We will enhance the credibility and efficiency of IP examination, and put in place a punitive compensation system to significantly raise the cost for offenders. Improvement of the business environment is an on-going process, and there is always room for things to become better. Countries need to improve their business environment by addressing their problems. They should not just point fingers at others to gloss over their own problems. They should not hold a âflashlightâ in hand doing nothing but to check out on the weakness of others and not on their own. Fourth, we will explore new horizons of opening-up. China will support its pilot free trade zones (FTZ) to deepen reform and innovation, make continued explorations based on their differentiated conditions and step up stress tests, so as to give full play to their role as a pilot ground for reform and opening-up. China will be quick to put forward policies and institutions for building a free trade port in Hainan in a step-by-step and phased manner, so as to speed up exploration of the development of free trade ports with distinct Chinese features. This is a significant move by China to open wider to the world. It will set a new model and open up new prospects for reform and opening-up at a higher level. Fifth, we will promote international cooperation at multilateral and bilateral levels. China believes that rules of the WTO should be upheld firmly, its necessary reforms should be supported and the multilateral trading system should be defended. China will strive for the early conclusion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and speed up negotiations on a China-EU investment agreement and a China-Japan-ROK free trade area. China will earnestly implement the eight major initiatives announced at this yearâs Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). China supports mechanisms such as the G20, APEC, the SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organization) and BRICS in playing greater roles in building a fairer and more equitable global economic governance system. China will continue to advance the Belt and Road Initiative through international cooperation in the spirit of consultation and collaboration for shared benefits. We will work with the participating countries on major projects, set up more trade promotion platforms and encourage more well-established and capable Chinese companies to invest in countries along the routes to enhance cooperation in areas of ecology, science and technology, culture and peopleâs livelihood. By so doing, we hope to set up for the whole world a platform for open cooperation. Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends, The Chinese economy is now on the whole stable and making good progress. For the first three quarters of this year, Chinaâs GDP grew by 6.7%, including a 6.5% growth registered for the third quarter, meeting our targeted goal for growth. Grain output for the whole year is projected to surpass 1.2 trillion jin (or 600 million tons). Some 11.07 million new jobs have been created in towns and cities, hitting our annual goal ahead of schedule. Judged by the main economic indexes, from GDP growth, job creation, consumer prices and international balance of payment to companiesâ profit margins, government fiscal revenue and productivity, Chinaâs economy is truly performing well within the reasonable range. This has given us a solid foundation for delivering the development goals for the whole year. And, compared with other major economies, China still ranks among the worldâs top in terms of GDP growth. So, when you talk about the future of the Chinese economy, you have every reason to be confident. The fundamentals for sound and stable growth of the Chinese economy remain unchanged. The necessary production factors for high-quality development remain unchanged. And the overall momentum of long-term stability and progress remains unchanged. Chinaâs capacity for macro-economic regulation is growing, as efforts to deepen reform across the board have unleashed new drivers of growth. With the Belt and Road Initiative being further implemented, two-way investment and trade between China and the BRI partner countries have continued to gather pace. All in all, the favorable conditions are in place for the long-term, healthy and steady growth of the Chinese economy. Of course, everything has two sides. The economic situation at home and abroad has created some significant challenges for the Chinese economy, such as more uncertainty in some sectors, more difficulties for some enterprises and growing risks in certain sectors. These challenges, generally speaking, are natural in the course of development. And we are taking active steps to solve them. Our efforts are already paying off. China is the worldâs second largest economy. We have a market of more than 1.3 billion consumers who live on the land of over 9.6 million square kilometers. To use a metaphor, the Chinese economy is not a pond, but an ocean. The ocean may have its calm days, but big winds and storms are only to be expected. Without them, the ocean wouldnât be what it is. Big winds and storms may upset a pond, but never an ocean. Having experienced numerous winds and storms, the ocean will still be there! It is the same for China. After going through 5,000 years of trials and tribulations, China is still here! Looking ahead, China will always be here to stay! I am convinced that as long as we have strategic confidence, deepen reform and opening-up across the board, intensify supply-side structural reforms and make greater efforts to solve outstanding problems, then the Chinese economy will surely make a quicker transition to high-quality development, the Chinese people will surely overcome all challenges coming our way, and China will surely embrace a brighter future of development. Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends, Every city has its character. Located at where the Yangtze River flows into the Pacific Ocean, Shanghai has been a pioneer of opening in China. The cityâs development is made possible by its character, competitive edge and steps toward greater opening. Having myself worked here, I know personally just how important it is for Shanghai to be open and for China to keep the city open. Indeed, openness, innovation and inclusiveness have become the hallmark of Shanghai. They are also a vivid reflection of China in the new era and its commitment to development and progress. To capitalize on the important role of Shanghai and other areas in Chinaâs opening-up, we have made the following decisions: First , we will expand the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone to include a new section, and will encourage and support bold and creative steps by Shanghai to advance investment and trade liberalization and facilitation so that more of its successful practices may be replicated in other parts of China. Second , we will launch a science and technology innovation board at the Shanghai Stock Exchange and experiment with a registration system for listed companies. We will also support Shanghai in cementing its position as an international financial center and a hub of science and innovation, and steadily improve the fundamental institutions of its capital market. Third , we will support integrated development of the Yangtze River Delta region. We will make it a national strategy and implement our new development philosophy in real earnest. We will build a modern economic system, and adopt higher standards for reform and opening-up. The region will develop in tandem with the Belt and Road Initiative, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei coordinated development area, the Yangtze River Economic Belt and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and will help improve the overall layout of Chinaâs reform and opening-up. Ladies and Gentleman, Friends, The CIIE is an event hosted by China with the support of the WTO and other international organizations as well as a large number of participating countries. It is not Chinaâs solo show, but rather a chorus involving countries from around the world. I hope that at the Hongqiao International Economic and Trade Forum, you will brainstorm ideas for reforming the global economic governance system, for jointly safeguarding free trade and the multilateral trading system, and for working together to foster an open global economy that is innovative and inclusive. Together, let us contribute to our common determined efforts to build a community with a shared future and usher in an even better tomorrow for mankind! Thank you.

Fact 5: On Nov. 1, China took the initiative to expand imports by further reducing the most-favored-nation tariff rate on 1,585 tax items such as stone and electromechanical equipment. After further adjustments, the total tariff level has dropped to 7.5%. Over the past 40 years since opening-up, China has fully demonstrated its firm confidence in actively expanding imports through a series of measures. CIIE is a major measure for China to firmly support trade liberalization and open its market to the world. It will serve as a new platform for all parties to enter the Chinese market. Follow Peopleâs Daily to learn more about the opportunities CIIE brings to the world."

It also integrates artificial intelligence with traditional imaging techniques to help doctors diagnose diseases earlier by comparing it with its database. Moreover, Medical device maker Medtronic will showcase the worldâs smallest non-wired cardiac pacemaker, which is the size of a coin. Time Medical will bring the worldâs first pediatric MRI machine to the expo. Siemens will present its new SOMATOM Drive, a dual source CT scanner that is used for general purpose imaging in a variety of cases including cardiology, EM, and pediatrics. Industry watchers believe that Chinaâs fast-growing medical device and healthcare market provides a historic opportunity for global companies. According to certain forecasts, by 2020, Chinaâs medical device market will exceed 770 billion yuan ($110 billion) and the size of its healthcare market will exceed 10 trillion yuan ($1.44 trillion). Representatives of many foreign enterprises believe that besides the promising market prospects, Chinaâs loose business market environment is also highly attractive. For instance, quick approval of HPV vaccines, a zero tariff policy on imported anti-cancer drugs, and so on, are all positive signs for foreign companies operating in China. âChina International Import Expo will serve as a window of Chinaâs openness to the world,â said Zhou Hong, general manager of Shanghai Roche Pharmaceuticals, the first Chinese joint venture of Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche. âIt will not only create more opportunities for cooperation between domestic and foreign companies, but will also lead people into a higher quality of life, especially meeting their growing medical and healthcare needs."" Zhou added."

The CIIE is scheduled to be held from Nov. 5 to 10 in Shanghai.(Xinhua/Han Yuqing) Many foreign enterprises are now eager to test water in the Chinese market as the countdown for the first China International Import Expo (CIIE) has started. The UK-headquartered biopharmaceutical enterprise AstraZeneca has meticulously planned the layout of its exhibition booth and brought the most cutting-edge products to the event, waiting for the arrival of the Chinese buyers. âAstraZeneca is a beneficiary of Chinaâs opening up and import expansion, and it has achieved fruitful results in the alignment between the worldâs wisdom and Chinese opportunities,â said Leon Wang, Executive Vice-President of International at AstraZeneca. He told Peopleâs Daily that the company has introduced over 30 innovative medicines since it entered Chinese market 25 years ago, and China has become the companyâs second largest market in the world. The country plays an increasingly vital role in AstraZenecaâs global operation no matter in R&D, production, or business innovation, he added. Chinaâs efforts to expand import in recent years have helped enterprises from more countries and regions board the express train of Chinaâs development. The country has offered tangible export market, development opportunities and jobs for the global economy, enhancing the spillover effect of economic development. American multinational conglomerate corporation 3M will debut a series of products during the CIIE, such as the smart car air purifier, the formaldehyde-degradation car floor mat, and childrenâs PM2.5-filtering mask. 3M has invested a total of over $1 billion in China since establishing an exclusively foreign-owned enterprise in the country in Nov. 1984. It has built 9 production bases, 4 technological centers and 2 R&D centers in China. An employee of the company told Peopleâs Daily that 3M hopes to showcase its cutting-edge technologies and innovative products at the CIIE, and fulfill its commitment to root in China and serve China. âWe are confident about Chinaâs future economic development, and are willing to expand investment and business in the country,â the employee added. âThe opening up of Chinese market and the CIIE will boost the economic and trade exchanges among countries and promote growth of global trade and world economy,â noted Bosch Home Appliances (BHA). An employee of the German company told Peopleâs Daily that the BHA would firmly support the opening up of Chinese market and trade facilitation, and keep enhancing its capabilities of local production and R&D in China. Now China enjoys a strong purchasing power in its consumption market thanks to the growth of peopleâs income and consumption upgrading. One of every three vehicles sold in the world is bought by Chinese. The per customer transaction of fresh food made by Chinese urban families averaged $15, and each urban household would make 121 such transactions each year. China also surpassed Japan to become the largest life insurance market in Asia, and nearly 80 percent of the newly added premium originated in Chinese market. It is reasonable for China to expand consumption of high-quality products and service import, since it will enrich consumption choices, optimize consumption structure, promote consumption upgrading, and satisfy peopleâs personalized, diversified and differentiated consumption demands. It is a reflection of Chinaâs people-oriented development philosophy. China has already lowered tariffs on many products of daily supplies. For instance, wines from Chile and Georgia, which were subjected to a tariff of 14 to 30 percent, can now enter China tariff-free; the tariff on tropical fruits from Association of Southeast Asian Nations such as durians, litchi and pitayas has been reduced to zero from 15 to 30 percent; and the salmons from Iceland have also been exempted from customs duty that stood at 10 to 12 percent. In addition, the tariff on some of the Swiss watches is now cut by half; the tariff on South Korean fridges and electric cookers has dropped by 40 percent and will be entirely removed in the next few years. What China is importing is not only products, but also services. Chinaâs policy to open up has accelerated the pace of foreign education, healthcare and finance sectors to enter the Chinese market, thanks to which the Chinese consumers can enjoy high-quality and internationalized services without going abroad. âIt is more important that to expand import not only meets short-term consumption demands, but also has a clear spillover effect on the transformation and upgrading of domestic industries,â said Zhao Ping, director of the international trade research department under the Academy of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. The steps to further open up will in turn force domestic service providers to upgrade, and finally enhance their supply capacity, Zhao noted, adding that it is a situation that all the Chinese consumers would like to see. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The article reflects the authorâs own views. On October 4, United States Vice President Mike Pence delivered a speech in Washington in which he said, âMuch of (Chinaâs) success was driven by American investment in China.â It goes without saying that the American people have become friendlier to China over the past few decades, and American investors have been friendly to China because it has been profitable. But what about the American government? In order to force China to submit to its agenda, the United States government, along with its vassal countries, imposed a series of large-scale economic sanctions on China around 1990. China's economic growth rate was pushed down from 11.2 percent in 1988 to 9.3 percent in 1991. But before long Washington had to waive the sanctions when the resilient Chinese people managed to restore the countryâs annual economic growth to double digits through continuous reform. The United States government also tried every means at its disposal to prevent China from joining the world trading system. It prevented China from resuming its status as a contracting party of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and set many obstacles in the way of China's accession to the World Trade Organization. A generation of negotiators devoted themselves into the cause of helping China return to the world trade family, undertaking 77 formal bilateral negotiations on China's accession to the WTO, including as many as 25 between China and the United States. Besides introducing the highest threshold for commodities and service trade with China, the United States forced China to leave a tail in the WTO accession agreement in the form of Article 15 of Chinaâs Protocol of Accession to the WTO. This allowed WTO members to disregard Chinaâs prices and costs in anti-dumping cases and base their calculation of dumping price margins on external benchmarks if producers couldnât show that market economy conditions prevailed in their industry. Given the obstacles it put in Chinaâs way, I donât see how Vice President Pence could seriously argue that the United States âbrought China into the World Trade Organization.â For the sake of a narrow and self-interested few, the United States government continues to suck the lifeblood from the international system it helped to build, like an economic leech. The result was the East Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, which saw American capitalists fleece East Asia. It hit China's economy hard, but the upside was that it forced China in a new direction of financial reform. The international financial crisis in 2008, caused by the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States, again put the world economy into a whirlpool of recession and slowed Chinaâs economic development. And now, Americaâs 2018 trade war with the world is directly targeting China and threatens to destroy the fruits of its reform and opening up. But even outside of these moments of crisis, it has not been smooth sailing. From 1980 to 2017, the United States launched 284 trade investigations against imports from China valued at 32.72 billion U.S. dollars. Over the course of the investigations, the United States employed unfair practices such as using surrogate countries, and subjected Chinaâs products to abnormally high tariff rates, which seriously affected the ability of Chinaâs enterprises to export to the United States. In addition to economic means, the United States government has spared no effort in employing military, political, and media methods to hinder Chinaâs development and create trouble for China domestically and internationally. From the South China Sea to Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang, and issues relating to international bodies and world governance, it almost seems to pain the United States government to give us a break on anything it sets eyes on. These are some contributions the United States government has made to China's reform and opening up â one failed attempt at sabotage after another. And it wonât stop until the ""America first"" policy has become worn out, and China's reform and opening up policy has become unbreakable. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

[Photo by Yu Fangping/For China Daily] China's eagerness to boost imports is driving the current account balance amid downward pressure, and the trend could be intensified after the year's biggest import tariff cuts take effect, influencing sentiment on financial stability and the exchange rate, according to experts. A new round of tariff reduction, on a wide range of industrial products and raw materials, began on Thursday, which drives down the country's overall tariff level for all categories to 7.5 percent from 9.8 percent in 2017. The refreshed tariff level, on average, is slightly higher than the European Union standard, but lower than most developing countries, which matches China's current development status, said an official from the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council. On the tariffs cut list, there are 1,585 categories of goods, including textiles, metals, electromechanical equipment and other raw materials and products. The affected items account for about 19 percent of the total number of taxed imports in China, according to a statement on the Ministry of Finance's website. ""Reducing import tariffs on some industrial products, that are much needed domestically, could attract more foreign capital and increase efficient market supply in China. It can also support the upgrading of industries and lower production costs,"" said the official. Earlier this year, China lowered import tariffs on a range of goods, including automobiles, medicines and some other daily consumer products. ""The additional tariff cuts will further support imports,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia Economics with Oxford Economics. ""As the trade tensions will depress export growth, China's current account surplus may continue to fall."" ""China's current account surplus will fall close to zero this year,"" he said. ""And it is also possible that the country will run a modest current account deficit in the coming years."" Zhang Ming, chief economist with Ping An Securities, said that the possible changes of the current account balance needs high attention. It may influence the market sentiment on financial stability, as the foreign exchange reserve may increase at a slower pace or even face downward pressure if the currency depreciation pressures rise. The country recorded a current account deficit in the first quarter this year, at $34.1 billion, the first deficit since the second quarter in 2001. A study from Oxford Economics, a British think tank, indicated that China's strong demand growth drove an average annual expansion of the real ""normal"" imports, meaning imported goods used in the domestic economy, at a rate of 8.9 percent from 2008 to 2017. It was in line with the fall in the current account surplus as a share of the GDP, from 9.9 percent in 2007 to 1.3 percent in 2017. Lower import tariffs, in addition, have contributed to an overall drop of the Chinese government's tax revenue in the first three quarters. Data from the Ministry of Finance showed that by the end of September, the government's income through levying import tariffs reached 221.6 billion yuan ($31.91 billion), a year-on-year decline of 0.9 percent. The total tax revenue growth slowed to 12.7 percent in the first three quarters from 14.4 percent in the first half. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

New estimates from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) show that the global foreign direct investment (FDI) dropped 41 percent year on year in the first half of 2018 to hit a decade low. Despite the drop, China was the largest recipient of FDI in the world for the period, UNCTAD said in the Global Investment Trends Monitor. Trade volume between China and economies participating in the Belt and Road Initiative amounted to 6.08 trillion yuan ($875 billion) in the first three quarters, an increase of 13.2 percent year-on-year, Gao said. The growth rate, according to him, was 3.3 percentage points higher than the country's overall trade expansion during the same period. Chinaâs export to Belt and Road countries recorded 3.38 trillion yuan, up 7.7 percent year-on-year, while imports were 2.7 trillion yuan, rising 20.9 percent from a year earlier, the spokesperson illustrated. In the first nine months, Chinese enterprises' non-financial direct investment into Belt and Road economies increased 12.3 percent year-on-year to $10.78 billion. The turnover of the engineering contracts signed by them in Belt and Road countries was $58.49 billion in the same period, a rise of 18.4 percent year on year. China had also co-built free trade zones with interested countries to facilitate trade and investment, Gao said, elaborating that it had completed free trade agreement negotiations with Mauritius, pushed ahead the negotiations on Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), discussed the upgrade of free trade agreement with Singapore, and consulted on free trade agreement with Moldova. The tariff-cut amendment of the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA) became effective, which allowed six APTA members including China, India, the Republic of Korea and Sri Lanka to cut tariffs by 33 percent on average for products under over 10,000 tariff codes. Additionally, a series of big projects including Addis AbabaâDjibouti Railway, Port of Piraeus and Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway had been put into operation, while construction of Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Britain, China-Laos railway, and rail line between Serbian capital Belgrade and the Hungarian capital of Budapest were moving ahead smoothly. Chinaâs e-commerce maintained a relatively high growth since the beginning of this year, according to Gao, who said that online retail sales totaled about 6.28 trillion yuan in the first nine months, up 27 percent year-on-year. Of the total amount, physical commodities registered an online retail sales of 4.79 trillion yuan, rising 27.7 percent year on year. The figure made up 17.5 percent of the total retail sales of consumer goods, and contributed 44.6 percent to the growth of the accumulative number. Gao added that the e-commerce law released by China this August offered a legal guarantee for sustainable and healthy development of e-commerce industry. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

A big part of the Chinese products subjected to the $200 billion tariffs are intermediate goods for American industry chains, David Dollar, a senior fellow of John L. Thornton China Center and global economic development project of Brookings Institution, told Peopleâs Daily. The additional tariffs will become a heavy burden for the US enterprises, he said, noting that if the tariff rate is elevated to 25 percent next year as planned, the American economy will have to pay high price for this, and the consumers will strongly feel the impact. He took the auto industry as an example, saying the high tariffs will increase the cost of auto parts and therefore cause a rise of auto prices, which will eventually be a burden on the consumers. The trade war wonât narrow the US trade deficit with China, Dollar pointed out. The surplus or deficit of a countryâs current account is decided by the balance between its savings and investment. To cut current-account deficit, a country has to enlarge savings, and the most effective way to achieve this is tax increase. However, the Trump administration is moving toward the opposite direction, Dollar pointed out, adding that because of Trumpâs tax cut, the US is facing higher trade deficit pressure this year. The researcher said he doesnât believe that the current-account deficit or surplus means a great issue for China and the US. Chinaâs economy shows much lower dependence on foreign trade, and its growth is mainly driven by domestic demandÂ¸ he explained. Dollar said the trade frictions between the two largest economies will possibly impact global economic growth this year. The American researcher, who has been in China for 9 years as World Bank's Country Director for China and Mongolia, an economic and financial emissary of the US Department of the Treasury, is a witness of Chinaâs reform and opening- up course. Dollar said China has undergone great changes in the last 40 years. A large proportion of the Chinese export value is created by private-owned enterprises, he stressed, adding that Chinaâs development and changes have proved the success of reform and opening-up. The trade war was started because of political reasons in the US, Dollar said, suggesting the US resolve economic and trade frictions, as well as appeals through dialogue and negotiations. The trade war goes against the common interests of the China and the US. Even the allies of the US are not for it initiating the trade war unilaterally, he said, warning that such move of Washington has in fact isolated itself in the international community. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

(Xinhua/Li Ying) LOS ANGELES, Oct. 26 -- U.S.-China Agriculture Food Trade Forum was held Thursday in the western U.S. state of California, focusing on the promotion of marketing communication and cooperation between the agriculture and food industry of the two countries amid Washington-triggered trade tensions. The event, jointly hosted by the Representative Office in the United States by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) and the China Certification and Inspection Group, CCIC North America Inc., attracted around 200 representatives from both countries. ""China's market need for soybeans and other U.S. agricultural products is huge and strong, but because of the trade conflicts between the two countries, people are now worried about the decline of the exports of U.S. agricultural products to China. That's one of the reasons why we are gathered here,"" said Zhao Zhenge, general representative of CCPIT Representative Office in the United States.

""Agriculture is one of the earliest sectors of China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation. China is now an important market for U.S. agriculture produce,"" he noted. According to Chinese customs statistics, China-U.S. agriculture trade in 2017 reached 31.8 billion U.S. dollars, equivalent to 5.4 percent of the total of bilateral trade. U.S. statistics show that China was the second largest export market of American agricultural products, the largest export destination of American soybeans and the second largest export destination of American cotton in 2017. On average, each American farmer exported some 12,000 dollars of agricultural products to China.

(Xinhua/Fan Jun) BEIJING, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- The first-ever China International Import Expo (CIIE), scheduled for Nov. 5-10 in Shanghai, will see the participation of over 130 countries and regions, and more than 2,800 companies. Here are some facts and figures about the event. HUGE OPPORTUNITIES China has been the world's second largest importer of goods for nine consecutive years, and made up 10.2 percent of global imports in 2017. It is one of the world's largest markets of high-end products such as industrial robots, chips and machine tools. The country announced import tariff cuts on 1,585 industrial products including machinery, spare parts and raw materials from Nov. 1, after removing tariffs from most imported medicine in May and reducing tariffs on autos and consumer products in July. The CIIE will see 160,000 buyers from over 80,000 domestic and foreign companies, exceeding the organizer's expectation of 15,000 companies. WIDE PARTICIPATION China has granted the status of ""Guest of Honor"" to 12 countries, namely, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Mexico, Pakistan, Russia, South Africa, Vietnam and the United Kingdom. More than 30 of the world's 44 least developed countries will participate in the event. The expo provides two standard booths free of charge for less developed countries. The CIIE will receive companies from all the G20 member states, as well as 50 countries and regions along the Belt and Road. Attending companies include more than 200 businesses on the Fortune Global 500 list, as well as a wide range of small and medium-sized companies such as fruit exporters in Southeast Asia and coffee makers in South America. HIGH-TECH PRODUCTS The CIIE will receive U.S. chip giants Qualcomm and Intel, Japanese electronics heavyweight Sony and Panasonic, as well as consumer goods leaders Unilever and Lego. German manufacturer Waldrich Coburg will exhibit a 200-tonne milling machine, the largest item on display at the expo. Eight world-leading machine tool producers will participate, with more than 10 exhibits making a first appearance in China, Asia or even globally. Exhibitors are expected to launch more than 100 new products and technologies at the event. High-end and intelligent equipment will occupy one of the CIIE's biggest exhibition zones, covering 60,000 square meters. VISITORS &Volunteers Around 300,000 visitors are expected to arrive in Shanghai during the expo. The municipality said it is geared up to accommodate visitors, and controlled room rates from Oct. 26 to Nov. 14. More than 5,000 volunteers are recruited for the CIIE, offering language services in English, Japanese, Russian, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and French. All volunteers are trained in language delivery, interpersonal communication, coping with stress and service protocol. HOST CITY With a population of around 24 million, the host city of Shanghai is China's industrial and commercial hub, and one of the country's earliest cities to build economic ties with foreign countries. Shanghai port has handled the most containers worldwide for seven consecutive years. In preparation for the expo, Shanghai has set up a specialized court and judicial team for handling civil and commercial cases concerning the expo, the conference and exhibition industry, the expo venue and commercial cases concerning foreign affairs. A special center to deal with disputes concerning intellectual property rights has also been set up. The municipal government has been renovating roads around the expo venue, and has developed cellphone applications to better guide traffic around the area. It added eight bus routes and prepared 100 spare buses for the event."

It's not a difficult question, but the United States has recently answered it in an absurd way. Some American observers think that what has come with a rising China are economic aggression, geopolitical expansion and damaged international rules. This is now taken as the official line of the US government. US President Donald Trump said on Sept 17 that Chinese practices ""plainly constitute a grave threat to the long-term health and prosperity of the United States economy"". On Oct 4, Vice-President Mike Pence attributed China's economic success largely to ""American investment in China"", saying the US rebuilt China over the last 25 years. But that is not true. Driver of global growth, not economic aggressor In his speech, Pence accused China of carrying out ""economic aggression"", saying China has used ""an arsenal of policies inconsistent with free and fair trade"" that ""have built Beijing's manufacturing base, at the expense of its competitorsï¼especially the United States of America"". He alleged that these actions of China have contributed to the huge trade deficit with the US and urged China to change the ""unfair"" practices. But trade is a two-way activity based on mutual agreement. China has never sought to buy from or sell to the US by force, neither has it eyed a trade surplus only. According to the UN statistics, the US exported $129.89 billion worth of goods to China in 2017, an increase of 577 percent compared with 2001, much higher than the 112 percent rise in US global exports over the same period. This happened against the backdrop of tight US restrictions on the types of goods exported to China, especially on high-tech products. In that sense, a slight easing of the restrictions would reduce the US trade deficit significantly. According to a study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in April 2017, if the US were to liberalize its export barriers against China to the same level as those applicable to Brazil, the US-China trade deficit would be narrowed by up to 24 percent. Similarly, should the US adjust its export barriers against China according to those applicable to France, its trade deficit with China would decrease by as much as 34 percent. Obviously the US has witnessed such a high trade deficit because it doesn't want to sell products to China, not the other way around. The service trade between China and the US also needs to be counted in. US statistics show that from 2007 to 2017, US service exports to China grew by 3.4 times from $13.14 billion to $57.63 billion, while its service exports to other countries and regions increased by 1.8 times. The US surplus with China in services multiplied by a factor of $30 billion to $40.2 billion. The gains and losses of China-US trade, being part of economic globalization, should be calculated from a global perspective. Over the past decades the US has moved its manufacturing industry such as processing and assembly to other parts of the world while keeping services such as design and marketing. China, being the largest receiver of international industrial relocation, has a large part of its exported goods actually produced by multinational companies from countries such as the US. In the value chain, multinational companies take the majority of profits while Chinese ones only take a tiny share for their processing payment. With dynamic development, China has become an important engine for international economic growth. China's contribution to world economic growth has stayed around 30 percent since 2013, topping other countries, and reached 34.6 percent in 2017, twice that of the US. China's development has also created a larger market for the world. From 2001 to 2017, China's imports of goods grew at an average rate of 13.5 percent, twice that of the world's average. In the same period China's service imports rose by 16.7 percent on average, 2.7 times that of the international average. From 2011 to 2017, the share of China's total imports of goods and services in the world's total increased from 8.4 percent to 10.1 percent, while that of the US dropped by 0.5 percentage point in the same period. China is also an important creator of jobs worldwide. So far it has set up more than 80 overseas economic and trade cooperation zones in countries along the Belt and Road routes, creating about 244,000 local jobs. And, according to Ernst& Young, China created over 130,000 jobs in Africa from 2005 to 2016, more than three times the number of jobs created by the US. And a study by the International Labour Organization released in 2017 found that between 1990 and 2016, at least 1.8 million jobs were created as a result of China's trade, investment and infrastructure projects in Latin America and the Caribbean. Some Americans allege that China has stolen American jobs because some American factories were relocated to China. Yet this allegation doesn't hold water. A report by the US-China Business Council released in early 2017 said the bilateral trade relationship actually supported roughly 2.6 million jobs in the US. And the US has lost more than 7 million factory jobs since manufacturing employment peaked in 1979, with 88 percent of the lost jobs taken by robots and other homegrown factors that reduce factories' need for human labor, according to a 2015 study by Ball State University's Center for Business and Economic Research. Where to set up factories is decided by US companies on profit-driven consideration, not by China. It's fair to say that China has not been an aggressor in its development, but a contributor to the world and a strong supporter of the UN Millennium Development Goals and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It has demonstrated a new path toward modernization for developing countries that are home to more than 80 percent of global population, and provided an option never seen before for countries that want both development and independence. Raphael Tuju, secretary-general of the ruling Jubilee Party of Kenya, said that China's achievement has no precedent in the history of mankind and gives African people ""a flicker of hope and light at the end of the tunnel"". China's development achievement is not driven by American investment, but the diligence and hard work of 1.3 billion Chinese people. Even in terms of investment, the US is not the largest investor in China. Since the 1980s, US investment has accounted for just 7-10 percent of foreign investment in China, while it has in return earned handsome profits. Builder of world peace that does not seek geopolitical expansion The US has accused China of conducting ""debt diplomacy"" to expand its influence, and Pence specifically referred to Sri Lanka. However, Karunasena Kodituwakku, Sri Lanka's ambassador to China, said in early October that ""If anybody is saying that the Chinese government gave its money to put Sri Lanka into a 'debt trap', I don't agree with that. It's an absolutely wrong conclusion"". The ambassador clarified that the security of Hambantota Port is entirely a matter for Sri Lankan security forces. Unfortunately in the US' geopolitical mindset, a country is an ally or a rival, there is no other option. Instabilities and uncertainties are currently the main threats to world peace. To tell threats from efforts to promote world peace, we need to tell behavior that creates conflicts from safeguarding stability. The Belt and Road Initiative accused by the US of being a scheme with ""geopolitical intent"" has attracted 103 countries and international organizations to sign 118 cooperation agreements under the Belt and Road framework with China. The initiative, together with its core concepts, has been incorporated into outcome documents of important international mechanisms such as the United Nations, G20, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and Shanghai Cooperation Organization. It is in fact a ""chorus"" beyond zero-sum mentality in the spirit of ""peaceful cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning, mutual benefit and win-win results"", fundamentally different from the concept of geopolitical expansion. China is committed to safeguarding peace and security and promoting global peace and stability through its own development and prosperity. China is the UN Security Council permanent member that dispatches the most peace-keeping troops, and it advocates and is committed to the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence. Till the first half of 2017, China had dispatched 35,000 peace-keeping military personnel who participated in 24 UN peace-keeping missions, and it has been praised as a ""key factor and key force of peace-keeping"" by the international community. China has never waged a war for the sake of oil or resources, nor has it used languages such as ""evil"" ""loser"" or ""shithole"" that are of no use except for triggering conflicts to attack other countries. Domestically speaking, China is among the main economies with the best public security. According to a survey by Gallop's 2018 Global Law and Order Report, China ranks among the top 10 safe tourist destinations globally, and among them it is the only main economy. The US, however, suffers from a woeful domestic security situation. Statistics show that from 2014 to 2017, deaths and injuries from gun crimes in the country have risen annually by 5 percent. In 2017 alone, the number reached 61,813, of which 15,637 people have died. On average, 170 people were killed or injured as a result of gun crimes every day in the US. As the self-appointed global sheriff, the US should have seen peace-keeping as its greatest responsibility, but it has all along been waging wars in the name of ""safeguarding world peace"". Since World War II, the US has started or participated in more than 30 wars. Its bellicosity has brought disasters for the world and even for its own people. The Iraq War launched by the US caused the deaths of 655,000 Iraqi people and 2,765 American soldiers from 2003 to 2012, leaving over 20,000 American soldiers injured or maimed. The US has meddled in the chaos in Syria, displacing large numbers of people. Till August 2018, there have been 5.6 million Syrian refugees registered by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The crisis has created profound implications for the whole world. The Afghanistan War started by the US in 2001 has caused over 300,000 deaths and injuries, and is still a ""bleeding wound"" today. New factors including economic security have become vital parts of global peace. Lower trade barriers work to enhance cooperation and foster economic stability. An increasingly open China has never initiated trade conflicts and has fully fulfilled its promises upon joining the World Trade Organization. China has also increased assistance to developing WTO members, especially the least developed countries, to close the development gap between the South and the North. By March 2018, it had implemented zero-tariff policies on 97 percent tax items from 36 least developed countries with diplomatic relations with China. This year, China has again declared that it will expand openness and widen market access, while speeding up all-sector openness in services, the finance industry in particular. On the other side of the world, however, the US in the name of ""reciprocal openness"" abuses ""national security"" and set up the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States that includes members from several government departments such as intelligence organs, constantly expanding its coverage and making ""national security"" a tool to block foreign companies trying to enter its market. In 2017 alone, CFIUS blocked more than 20 foreign companies from entering the US market in the name of ""national security"", over half of which were Chinese companies. Both the US and China are WTO members, so economic and trade issues between them should be resolved within the WTO framework. But the US has arbitrarily dealt with trade frictions with China according to its domestic laws despite the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism. This deviates from the basic principles of the WTO and runs against its obligations for tariff concession and most-favored-nation treatment. The US president even threatened China by saying, ""if China takes vindictive actions against our farmers or other industries, we will immediately take a third step: imposing customs on an extra $267 billion of imports from China"". This is exactly the modern example of the saying ""one may steal a horse while another may not look over the hedge"". China safeguards rather than breaks the international order The US often accuses China of ""not obeying international rules"" and slanders China's role in the international community, calling it a revisionist state. Many things China does are labeled actions that ""break international rules."" The fact is, however, China has directly participated in building the post-World War II global order as a founding member of the UN. China's representative Dong Biwu was the first to sign the UN Charter. Since it took its lawful seat in the UN and all its affiliated organizations in 1971, China has continually joined international organizations. Currently, China has joined more than 400 multilateral agreements, all UN organizations and about 90 percent of inter-governmental ones, fully involved in the current global order. According to the Yearbook of International Organizations 2017-18, China's participation rate in international organizations, the fastest growing among the main economies, is rapidly nearing those of France and Germany. Many studies have concluded that China has been fully integrated into the international system and it stands as a steadfast upholder of and contributor to the global order. More and more countries expect China to play a greater role in global governance. In recent years, China has proposed the Belt and Road Initiative in the spirit of achieving shared growth through consultation and collaboration and started the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, which is conducive to the current global order. China has also hosted major events such as the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, G20 Hangzhou Summit, first Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, and the ninth BRICS Summit. It has reiterated the concept of deepening reform and expanding opening-up and welcomed other countries to take a ride on China's development. It has been well received by the international community. China's circle of friends keeps expanding. The US as the leader in global order after WWII, on contrary, now keeps breaking the global order by ""exiting"", threatening to exit, or even ""disbanding organizations"". For example, it has withdrawn from Paris Agreement against climate change, United Nations Human Rights Council, UNESCO, Global Compact on Migration, and the Iran nuclear deal. The G7 led by the US used to play an important role in global governance. Nowadays, however, internal rifts have become its focus. Besides, the US intends to reshore industries such as automobile manufacturing, and iron and steel that enjoy a well-established global order, sending shocks through the EU and Japan. It is China that is safeguarding the global order, and the US is the spoiler. Unilateralism and a zero-sum mentality have no future. However the world may change, China will stay steadfastly with the international community and remain devoted to building a new type of international relations, a community with a shared future for mankind and make greater contributions to the progress of mankind.

Especially since last year, the US with its frequent trade protectionist moves, has been doing nothing but reversing the trend of globalization. The development of world economy since the 18th century proves that the in-depth promotion of economic globalization leads to prosperity of global economy, while anti-globalization would only lead to stagnation. As a major form of anti-globalization, a country adopting trade protectionism only hurts others without benefiting itself, and there will be no winner in such a situation. The Hoover administration of the US issued the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, raising tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods with the aim of reducing imports and getting rid of the overstocked US commodities. However, the results were opposite to the countryâs wish. Trade partners of the US took counteractions one after another, which led to a drastic drop of the US exports. This protectionist policy was considered by historians as one of the reasons of the Great Depression that later resulted in a worldwide economic downturn. At present, the US is declaring a massive trade war despite the opposition of the world, becoming the biggest uncertainty for the global economic recovery. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated that the losses caused by the trade war between the US and other countries might lower global growth by 0.5 percent for 3 consecutive years, or about $430 billion in lost GDP worldwide. The US used to be a leader and the largest beneficiary of economic globalization, but now it has turned into a destroyer of international trade rules and economic globalization as it hopes to transfer domestic contradictions, exploit maximum benefits and constrain the development of other countries on strategic level. The US is the last country in the western world to establish social security system. Valuing capital and making light of labors, the US suffers acute social diseases such as unfair distribution of income and severe social inequality. During the past decades, especially since the 21st century, the US has seen increasingly worsened social inequality. In recent years, the wealthiest one percent families in the country earned 20 percent of the total national income, up from 9 percent in 1978. In addition, the richest 10 percent US households occupy over three quarters of the countryâs total family fortunes, while the poorest half households only have one percent of the total fortunes. In 2017, the median net assets of African Americans and Latino Americans were only 10.29 and 12.11 percent of that of the white Americans. The gap of wealth and social inequality are always hidden behind economic prosperity, but they will be gradually exposed when recession comes. For instance, after the 2008 international financial crisis, the Occupy Wall Street campaign to protest against economic inequality broke out. However, the income gap in the US still got wider, and the social polarization was also worsening, which triggered strong dissatisfaction among the medium- and low-income earners. Faced with intractable domestic contradictions, the US has resorted to populism and bullying practices, passing the buck to other countries and provoking trade disputes. By doing so, the US wishes to protect the interests of its monopolistic capital and divert attention of its people. As the emerging markets and developing countries enjoy rapid progress in recent years, the US has seen a decline of its status in global economy. In 1960, the US economy accounted for nearly 40 percent of the worldâs total. However, the figure slid to 24 percent in 2016. In the meantime, the share of global GDP from emerging markets hit 38.8 percent in 2016. The emerging markets and developing countries, conducting manufacturing in the medium and low end of the value chain that only generates a narrow margin, are continuously providing cost-efficient products to the world. They have promoted world economic prosperity and balanced development, improving the general living standard of mankind. The developed countries, including the US, have benefited much from the global market expansion and the enhanced international division of labor, thanks to their position at the high end of the value chain. These largest beneficiaries of economic globalization are still leading the world in terms of economic development and per capita GDP. However, some narrow-minded people in the US, affected by the zero-sum mentality, believe that they are actually at a disadvantage if others are developing. From withdrawing from international organizations to imposing additional tariffs, they have a deep conviction that their country can benefit more if they force other countries to make concessions. In order to protect its supremacy, the US has always been on guard of the countries that could possibly catch up with it. There is a saying that when a country develops an economy as big as 60 percent of that of the US and keeps strong momentum for growth, the US would take it as a rival and try every possible means to constrain the latterâs development. The Soviet Union, Japan, and China have all been the victims. In order to suppress other countries, the US has trampled on international rules, undermined world economic orders, and built high trade barriers. However, the economic globalization is an irreversible trend, and to deprive a major country of the right to develop also goes against the historical law and international morality. With the coming of the 21st century, the US would only harm itself without benefiting the others if it still sticks to the old thinking of the colonial era as well as the Cold War and zero-sum mentalities. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Among them, hopeful words like ""opportunities"", ""chance"",""promising"" and ""great platform"" are most frequently mentioned when referring to the mega expo, which will be held in Shanghai on Nov. 5-10. From the big beneficiaries of China's opening-up policy like European auto-industry giants to fresh comers such as African food and beverage suppliers, there is a common aspiration to make best of the expo to promote their brands and products, and take bigger shares in the lucrative market of China. ""We look forward to meeting companies we can collaborate with as we are always seeking to expand our ecosystem of partners,"" said German software corporation SAP in a statement. It told Xinhua that the CIIE provides a new platform for global businesses to collaborate and promotes common prosperity of the world economy and trade. Metro, a leading German international company in wholesale and food retail, said that it wants to take the opportunity of the CIIE to showcase its strength in imports and global sourcing. Philippe Palazzi, chief operating officer and management board member of Metro AG, said: ""We also want to use such a great platform to enhance our exchange and communication with local customers, business partners and other stakeholders as we are committed to the long-term development in China."" For Danish brand Danisa, which sees itself as a ""beneficiary of China's opening-up to the world policy,"" the expo means more customers and partners. ""We believe that through this event we will have better exposure in China and find more partners to help us distribute our products to not only tier-1/tier-2 cities, but also further into tier-3/tier-4/tier-5 cities,"" said Erik Bresling, CEO of Danisa. Companies which are believers of China's development and beneficiaries of the opening-up policy make a big part of CIIE participants. Regional delegations also attach great importance to the platform, viewing it as a gateway and window to know better China's market and development path. So far, over 150,000 buyers from home and abroad are estimated to attend the expo. Apart from business exhibitions, 80 countries and three international organizations have confirmed their participation in the country-pavilion exhibition, which covers a total area of 30,000 square meters. Horacio Licon, vice president of the Greater Houston Partnership, an economic development organization serving the Greater Houston area, told Xinhua that the expo is a great opportunity for Houston to continue developing its trade relationship with China, the second largest trading partner of the region. Licon will lead a team of 15 delegates representing 12 companies to Shanghai in November, which cover diverse industries such as technology, manufacturing, energy and logistics. ""We have expectations in terms of understanding and hearing directly from our Chinese counterparts on the private sector and on the government side, the messages about the future of Chinese trade, how the government is seeing the future of Chinese trade and how Houston will play a role in that relationship,"" Licon said. The American delegate's concern is understandable as the U.S.-initiated tariff frictions with major trade partners are threatening the hard-won international trade rules and prickling China-U.S. economic ties. According to John Edwards, British consul-general in Shanghai, the CIIE is a great opportunity for newcomers to understand the Chinese market as well as the customers while on the other hand, it is also ""a very special symbol of China's opening-up."" His comments echoed President Xi Jinping's remarks on the expo. ""Looking ahead, China will open still wider and its development will deliver even greater benefits to the rest of the world,"" Xi said in a speech at the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Vietnam last year, adding that the CIIE ""will help all parties to better share the opportunities of China's development."" ""The expo sends a strong message from China in favor of free trade and multilateralism,"" Argentine political observer Patricio Giusto, who is head of consulting firm Diagnostico Politico (Political Diagnosis), told Xinhua in a recent interview. According to official data, more than 2,800 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have confirmed their participation in the first CIIE. Some companies such as Metro and accounting firm EY have even registered for the 2019 expo as they believe that free trade and opening-up that China always advocates is win-win for everyone. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"
27,http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2018/1017/c90000-9509241.html,Op-ed: Trade war cannot stop China from moving forward,"October 17, 2018","The trade war couldnât stop the development of Chinaâs economy, many world renowned scholars, mainstream media and prominent organizations expressed their optimism on Chinaâs future, under the background that the US government initiated the trade war against China and escalated tensions this year. They believe that China has the ability to safeguard its own interests. One of the âchargesâ that the US accuses against China is the so-called intellectual property theft. However, the âchargeâ is indeed groundless. Former US Treasury Secretary and economist Lawrence Summers noted that the leadership of Chinese companies in some technologies was not a result of the theft from the US, rebutting the premise behind US President Donald Trumpâs trade actions against China. He believed China's technological progress came from terrific entrepreneurs who had got the benefit of huge government investments in basic science, and an educational system that's privileging excellence, concentrating on science and technology. âThat's where their leadership is coming from, not from taking a stake in some US company,â Summers said. Honorary professor Hiroshi Yoshikawa of the University of Tokyo commented that the US was worried that it might be exceeded by China in terms of GDP, citing an estimate by the Financial Times that Chinese economy would overtake that of the US in about a decade. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize winning economist and professor at Columbia University, remarked that the US had already been lost when facing a country like China that might replace it in multiple fields, including the most advanced. âWill July 6, 2018, turn out to be a date of economic infamy?â The question was raised by the Washington Post in one of its articles. The date, which marked the coming of the first round of US tariffs on China, was considered an equivalent of June 17, 1930, the day when US President Herbert Hoover signed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. This act led to the rising trade protectionism and deteriorated great depression, and it was also an indirect reason for the outburst of the World War II. Many international observers have noticed that what the US aims at with its tariff plan is the âMade in China 2025â initiative. The US didnât want to see a rising China in the technological sector, said Zheng Yongnian, director of the East Asian Institute, National University of Singapore. He noted that the US hoped to at least slow down Chinaâs modernization so the latter would fall into the âmiddle income trapâ or go back to âimpoverished socialismâ. However, the US efforts to stop Chinaâs steps in high technologies are not able to hinder the development of Chinaâs scientific innovation capability, competitiveness of Chinese tech firms or the reserves of scientific personnel. âThey are deluded if they see China as ever dependent on Western innovation. The country I have come to know is investing in research and knowledge as never before,â said President of the University of Sheffield Keith Burnett. China had taught a billion people to read and write, and built a modern infrastructure of roads and high-speed trains, he noted, adding that Chinaâs innovation base was now roughly equal to that in the US. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in the 2018 Article IV Consultation report issued on July 26, said that the direct macro impact of tariffs announced to date appeared limited. The report was generally positive about Chinaâs economic performance, giving an optimistic forecast on the sustainability of Chinaâs economic development. As China is continuously deepening reform and opening up, shifting its economy to one that relies on domestic demand and is driven by innovation, and diversifying its foreign trade structure, the trade war initiated by the US will not be able to reverse the developing trend of Chinese economy. UK expert on Chinese affairs Hugh Peyman pointed out in his newly published book âChina's Change: The Greatest Show on Earthâ, that those who doubted the Chinese mode often misjudged the complicated reality faced by China, the second largest economy in the world, and ignored Chinaâs ability of adjustment and continual reforming. He believed that China would finally find its own path as long as it continued to reform when facing challenges. Global analysts explain that the US initiated the trade war out of the strategic consideration to comprehensively contain Chinaâs rapid development. However, most of the experts hold that there is no sufficient evidence to prove that additional tariffs could stop the economic progress of China. âThe fate of China, and its role in the world, is now in the hands of the Chinese and their leaders,â noted Kenneth Rogoff, professor of economics and public policy at Harvard University. âThe globalization train has went a long distance since it left the station, and the idea that one can turn it back is utterly naÃ¯ve,â he further added. China, holding the banner of globalization, is winning more and more friends. However, the US, in the meantime, has lost its reputation in the world due to its protectionist trade policies. Philip Stephens, associate editor and chief political commentator of the Financial Times said that the US was already surrendering advantage to its rival in the inevitable global contest between these two great powers. Any short term pain should be set against the immense strategic gain for China flowing from Trumpâs worldview, and Trump was progressively dismantling the pillars of the US-led international order, he remarked. Chinaâs long-term strategic goals are clear enough, and Trump has set about this task with gusto, the associate editor added. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"
28,http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2018/1015/c90000-9508456.html,Opinion: win-win outcome in understanding US-Sino relationship,"October 15, 2018","In the midst of an ever-escalating tariff war, I do not share the view that Sino-American tensions are all about trade imbalances. The real battle is a strategic clash over innovation and technology. Yes, there is a large and seemingly chronic trade imbalance between the United States and China that is growing even wider today. But this is just as much a function of Americaâs own macroeconomic problems as a reflection of unfair Chinese trading practices long alleged by the Washington consensus and now underscored by the shrill rhetoric of the Trump Administration. The United States suffers from a chronic deficiency of domestic saving. Its net national saving rate was just 3% in the first half of 2018 â up a bit from the 1.9% post-crisis average (2009-17) but still less than half the 6.3% norm of the final three decades of the 20th century. Lacking in saving and wanting to invest, consume, and grow, the US must import surplus saving from abroad and run massive current account and trade deficits to attract foreign capital. The United States had trade deficits with 102 nations in 2017 â a multilateral problem. By opting for budget-busting tax cuts in late 2017, Americaâs already depressed domestic saving will move sharply lower in the years ahead, pushing its current account and trade gaps even deeper into deficit. Moves to rectify this imbalance with tariffs against China will only backfire. The Chinese piece of the trade deficit will shift to higher-cost trading partners, putting more pressure on American consumers. That is already happening. There can be no bilateral fix for a multilateral problem. Trade deficits are a foil for a far more profound struggle between the US and China. A recent White House policy paper says it all: ââ¦the Chinese State seeks to access the crown jewels of American technology and intellectual property.â White House advisor Peter Navarro adds that, âChina has targeted Americaâs industries of the future â¦ if China successfully captures these emerging industries, America will have no economic future.â These charges draw heavily on the March findings of a so-called Section 301 investigation conducted by the US Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, a report which has become central to the national anti-China narrative. Unfortunately, the USTRâs conclusions are wide of the mark in these areas: Joint ventures. Allegations of forced technology transfers through the JV structure overlook the most basic aspect of these arrangements â two partners working together willingly, in the context of commercially and legally binding agreements, to create a business that requires a sharing of personnel, systems, and processes. That was certainly my own experience as a senior executive in a joint venture between my former employer, Morgan Stanley and the China Construction Bank in building Chinaâs first investment bank, CICC. At no point was I forced to turn over anything to my Chinese partners. Outbound capture. The USTR also charges China with technology theft through its âgoing outâ policies of acquiring US companies and their proprietary systems. Such allegations of predatory behavior are exaggerated. Tabulations by the American Enterprise Institute find that only 16 of Chinaâs 228 outward bound M&A deals over the decade ending in 2017 were in the technology sector; that compares with fully 51 deals in the real estate sector over the same period. Industrial policy. The USTR insists that China is using industrial policies, such as Made in China 2025 or AI 2030, to gain an unfair advantage in the acquisition of foreign technology. Yet from Japan to Germany to Pentagon-sponsored innovations of Americaâs military-industrial complex, industrial policies have been more the rule than the exception for todayâs leading economies. The allegations leveled against China by the USTR make it sound as if the Chinese are interlopers â that they have no rightful claim to the hallowed ground of innovation that has long defined the prosperity of nations. That overlooks the simple but important fact that ancient China was the worldâs preeminent innovator. From agricultural production to textile weaving, from paper and printing to missiles and gunpower, from magnetic polarity and navigational guidance to breakthroughs in civil and mechanical engineering and nautics, from discoveries of synthetic insulin to ferrous metallurgy and ceramic technology, Chinaâs extraordinary breakthroughs in science and technology came well before the 18th and 19th century agricultural and industrial revolutions in Europe, and the United States. By the late 11th century, Chinaâs per capita iron output was five to six times the European average; by the 13th century, Chinese textile spinning was operating at efficiency levels that Europe would not enjoy for another 500 years. While the innovation debate is of critical importance to the current dispute between the US and China, it raises an even deeper question: Will China make the transition from imported to home-grown, or indigenous, innovation that is required to avoid the dreaded âmiddle-income trapâ which has long ensnared most developing nations? On this count, there are five pieces of compelling evidence to believe that China will pull it off: Silicon Valley-like hubs. Hubs provide the cultural assimilation between leading universities, venture capital investors, and serial entrepreneurs. China has established 17 tech hubs. The most notable include the so-called Greater Bay Area (the broader Pearl River Delta area â Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangdong), Z-Park in Beijing (Zhongguancun Software Park), and the Guangzhou Innovation Hub. Comparable efforts have sprung up in Shanghai Pudong (i.e., Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park as well as the Lujiazui fintech incubation center) and, more recently, at Tsinghua University (the Tsinghua Institute for Artificial Intelligence). Start-up companies. Hubs foster start-ups, providing incentives for a new generation of innovators and entrepreneurs. Over the past decade, the Chinese start-up culture has hit its stride. China now has over 160 âunicornsâ â private companies with valuations in excess of $1 billion each â versus about 130 unicorns in the United States. Chinaâs unicorns span the gamut â from the fintech of internet finance, to a vast e-commerce platform, to online travel, to cloud computing, to big data management, to new energy, and logistics. Moreover, there is also a large population of listed Chinese companies which are already on the leading edge of the global innovation curve â from e-commerce and social media giants like Alibaba, Tencent, JD.com, and Baidu, to world-class leaders in DNA sequencing and biogenetics such as BGI and Hengri, to high-speed rail, autonomous vehicles, and artificial intelligence, where China and the United States are the global leaders in what could well be this centuryâs most important technology gambit. Strategy and governance. The lessons of ancient China are not without interest in assessing the future of Chinese innovation and technological development. Then, as now, success hinges on implementation and effective governance to catalyze the creative spark of entrepreneurs and innovators. Chinaâs two high-profile industrial polices, MIC2025 and AI2030, are clear signs that modern China will differentiate itself from its ancient past. Chinaâs innovation DNA. Chinaâs DNA as an unparalleled historic innovator is very much evident today. Chinese educational reforms are now turning out university graduates of more than 1.7 million scientists and engineers per year. And itâs not just quantity â the quality is increasingly impressive. From nanoscience and nanotechnology, to quantum networking, to stem-cell research and regenerative medicine, to gene editing and the genetics of cancer research, to AI-related breakthroughs that put China, at most, only one year behind the United States. The new innovators of modern China speak volumes to the nationâs own âcrown jewels.â R&D. US National Science Foundation data put Chinese spending on overall research and development of $409 billion in 2015 (in international dollars) â nearly double that of 2010 and second only to Americaâs $497-billion; significantly, fully 84% of overall Chinese R&D expenditures is earmarked for âexperimental development,â making China the global leader in this leading-edge category. Equally compelling, the NSF also reports that in 2016 China surpassed the United States as the worldâs leader in academic science and engineering publications. This evidence takes us to an even bigger question: Is China is coming full circle â from an ancient civilization that once led the world in innovation and technology to a modern nation now focused on research, scientific development, indigenous innovation, and commercialization of these activities? By fixating on IP theft, cyberhacking, and forced technology transfer, the USTRâs stress on the dark side Chinese innovation allows for literally no consideration of this possibility. That may well be one of Americaâs most egregious oversight. Much has been made over the race for technological supremacy as the decisive factor in the struggle for economic dominance between China and the United States. There is, however, an alternative interpretation. Each economy needs the productivity payback from technology and innovation for its own purposes â China to avoid the middle-income trap and the United States to counter the risks of economic stagnation that might well arise from another productivity slowdown that now appears to be under way. Resolving the innovation dilemma does not imply defeating the other in the arena of global power. This contrast between the zero-sum imagery of the conflict and a win-win outcome of mutual success is of great potential importance in understanding and ultimately resolving the strains in the US-Sino relationship. In the end, Americaâs race, like that of most nations, is more with itself than with any purported foreign adversary. Americaâs scapegoating of China would make Don Quixote blush. It is a convenient excuse for ducking the tough issues of economic strategy that the United States has avoided for decades â namely, its saving and productivity imperatives. Both the US and China face formidable economic challenges in the years ahead. They both win if they solve their own problems. They both lose if they attack the other in a destructive and diversionary trade war. The longer the current US-Sino dispute persists, the deeper those convictions are likely to become ingrained on both sides of the relationship. And then, the long and tragic history of struggles between rising and ruling powers â the so-called Thucydides Trapâ will become all the more relevant. Resolving the innovation dilemma is key to avoiding that potentially dire outcome.

As a core stakeholder in the second and third technological and industrial revolutions, it has gained huge profits because of its advantages as the first comer. The US rose to the top spot of the world regarding industrial output in 1894, and took a grasp of nearly half of the worldâs gold reserve 30 years later, thanks to which it greatly raised its global financial influence. The dollar supremacy formed after the World War II not only brought the US constant economic benefits, but also became a tool for the country to transfer crisis. âRejecting globalization,â an American journalist wrote years ago, âwas like rejecting the sunrise.â But todayâs US is pointing its gun at the world by increasing trade barriers, ignoring the World Trade Organization (WTO), and challenging the free trade rules. Vice President of the US Mike Pence claimed in a recent speech that âwe will demand that Beijing break down its trade barriers, fulfill its obligations, fully open its economy â just as we have opened oursâ. But the Vice President, on the other hand, talked at length the trade protectionism adopted by the US, claiming that the US has recently strengthened CFIUS --the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US-- heightening the countryâs scrutiny of Chinese investment in America. Any logic? The speech was self-contradictory. The US certainly knows the benefits of free trade, and is aware that economic globalization cannot be realized without Chinaâs participation. When the subprime mortgage crisis broke out in the US in 2007, which was later upgraded to an international financial crisis, the US changed its arrogant attitude and found China for negotiation, proposing to initiate the G20 summit for countermeasures. Facts proved that emerging economies and developing countries have made remarkable contribution to the recovery of world economy. The US, relying on this platform, also started to resume vigor soon and secured a more than 2 percent economic growth on average between 2010 and 2017. But the US kicked down the ladder immediately after the recovery. When it was facing difficulties, it shared the woes with its trading partners and enjoyed the benefits of economic globalization and free trade, but when it saw a sign of pick-up, it put on a cold face and accused the others of damaging free trade. Behind such practice was the hegemony and selfishness of the US, which was revealed by the so-called âAmerica firstâ policy. The âAmerica firstâ, in simple explanation, is the US will do whatever it wants to do. It will strike down its competitors with any possible means including trade. The victims of the US hegemony include the Soviet Union in the Cold War, the US ally, Japan in the 1980s and 1990s, as well as todayâs European Union, Canada, Mexico and Turkey. Of course, it is not the first time for the US to turn hostile to a partner. The US economy was prosperous after the World War I, with its average annual economic growth amounting to nearly 4 percent between 1923 and 1929. Its industrial production accounted for 48.5 percent in capitalist countries. However, the imported goods became a scapegoat for the dull sale of the US exports. In 1930, Washington increased tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods by introducing the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. The average tariff rate rose to 59.1 percent in 1932 from 40.1 percent in 1929, but the US exports fell to $1.65 billion from $5.2 billion. As a result, the global trade volume largely shrank to $12 billion from $36 billion. Back to then, the great depression it hardly got rid of and retaliation from other countries against the US further intensified global political and economic crisis. In the end, the US had to return to free trade after the new policies issued by the then US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. At present, the US has turned from an advocator into a destroyer of economic globalization, mainly because it believes that its global monopoly and super-normal profit cannot be secured in the current globalization. The ongoing moves of the US are a copy of what it did in the 1930s, and will certainly exertnegative impacts on global political and economic security. US politicians accused China of conducting âplundering economyâ, saying China has adopted numerous unfair policies and practices and the US is at a disadvantage in its trade with China. Such remarks are nothing but ridiculous. Chinaâs imports of commodities grew by 13.5 percent each year on average from 2001 to 2017, twice the growth of the global average. In 2017, China has grown into the worldâs largest exporter of goods, the second largest receiver of capital inflow, and the third largest source of foreign investment. At present, China is the largest trading partner of more than 120 countries, among which the top 15 absorbed nearly 70 percent of its total export volume, and 8 countries and regions maintain a trade surplus with China. In addition, a great many developing countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa also maintain a trade surplus with China. Why so many countries and regions are willing to conduct business with China if China truly has adopted the so-called âplundering economyâ against its trading partners? How could most of the countries and regions maintain a trade surplus with China if the latterâs trade was really predatory? Besides, the argument that China is taking advantage of the US in their trade relations cannot hold water either. The two-way trade between the two countries experienced a sharp rise after China joined the WTO. The sales volume of US enterprises in China was only $45 billion in 2001, but soared to $600 billion in 2016. Thanks to Chinaâs rapid economic development and huge consumption potential, many US enterprises achieved development, and even prolonged their vitality on Chinese market. For instance, General Motors, which experienced bankruptcy restructuring during the 2008 financial crisis, places 45 percent of its overseas business in China. Its two joint ventures in China registered a revenue of 27.99 billion yuan in 2017, 13.33 billion yuan of which went to General Motors. In the same period, the companyâs global operation ended up losing. Researches by the Peterson Institute for International Economics indicated that the US would lose about a million jobs if its trade friction with China escalated. The technological advances and continuously improving productivity are the driving force of economic globalization. This driving force, never relying on certain countries or people, is not private asset. The rising trade protectionism is nothing but a small countercurrent that is not able to stop the trend of economic globalization. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Bret Davis, a soybean farmer in Delaware, Ohio, said he suffered economic losses of more than $400,000 this summer. He told Peopleâs Daily that if the prices for soybeans remain low in the next two to three years, he would be unable to afford his household bills. Ohio is located in the Great Lakes region of the US and its economic aggregate is among the top ten in the country. According to local media, a report by the Ohio State University indicated that prolonged tariff measures will reduce the net income of cultivated crop growers in the state by 59 percent. American soybean planters spent 35 years exploring the Chinese market, Davis said. Before the trade frictions, one third of American soybeans were exported to China. The widely opposed tariff policy forced the US government to propose a farm subsidy plan to offset the losses. However, the plan was like a band-aid, which was far from being able to heal the big wound caused by the trade war, Davis said, adding that the longer the tariff measures persist, the harder it will be to repair the damages created. Ian Sheldon, an economist and a professor of international trade and economics at Ohio State University, said the trade war has brought great uncertainties and means a blow to investment. For instance, Canadian enterprises are less enthusiastic in investing in northern America because of it. The American enterprises will need a couple of months, even years to transfer its supply chains and find suitable new suppliers, said a letter to the US trade representative Robert Lighthizer written by Americans for Free Trade, an organization jointly established by more than 80 American trade associations. They stressed in the public letter that Washington didnât give them enough time to redesign their supply chains, as the new tariffs came into effect just 6 days after the list of Chinese imports subjected to additional tariffs was announced. This move is unacceptable for them. The US ship manufacturers experienced a sharp rise in production cost due to the additional tariffs on imported Chinese steel and aluminum, as well as Chinese vessel parts. Maggie Sheely, manager of congressional and public affairs for the US Chamber's Great Lakes region, told Peopleâs Daily that a large number of small- and medium-sized enterprises are challenged by the same issue, adding that some of these enterprises would only last a few months before they go bankrupt. While only 900 US enterprises benefited from the additional tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum, 30,000 suffered losses due to the tariff policy, she noted. Statistics showed that $3.3 billion worth of goods exported from Ohio to Canada, China, Mexico and Europe would be affected by the US tariff policy, the 7th highest figure in the US. In addition, about 1.5 million jobs in the state are supported by international trade. In addition to foreign trade, economists believe the prices of daily consumer goods will also rise as the US government keeps widening the range of goods subjected to rising tariffs. As a result, every American household will be burdened by the tariffs. Sheldon said trade researchers know that adding tariffs will lead to a rise of prices of domestic consumer goods. Washington sees trade as a zero-sum game, but trade has been widely regarded as a win-win behavior since the period of Adam Smith. The economist feels very anxious about the current US trade policy. During the two World Wars, the US tariff policy aggravated global economic crisis. Learning from this, the US Democrats and Republicans generally supported multilateral free trade mechanism, except the Trump administration. The wrong trade policy of the US would hurt multilateral trade system, Sheldon concluded. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

In the Jan.-Sept. period, China imported 336 million tonnes of crude oil, 64.78 million tonnes of natural gas and 24.59 million tonnes of refined oil. Imports of iron ore and soybean dropped by 1.6 percent and 2 percent to 803 million tonnes and 70.01 million tonnes, respectively, during the same period. Meanwhile, China's overall import price has grown by 4.2 percent. Major bulk commodities, including crude oil, natural gas and copper, have seen an increase both in volume and in price. Li Kuiwen, a spokesperson with the General Administration of Customs, attributed the increase in imports to the government's favorable measures, including tax cuts, policies to optimize the business environment and tariff reductions. China lowered its value-added tax on imports as well as taxes on vehicles and auto parts, medicines, and consumer goods in 2018. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The US-China trade relations are mutually voluntary and complementary. China has never looked for a forced trade relationship with the US, or a trade surplus. Statistics by the United Nations (UN) indicated that in 2017 US exports of goods to China amounted to $129.89 billion, a 577% increase from $19.18 billion in 2001, much higher than the average growth rate of overall US exports that stood at 112 percent in the same period. It is noteworthy that the growth was achieved as the US has strictly restricted the categories of exports to China and banned the sales of certain high technologies. The US trade deficit with China would probably be narrowed if the US allowed sales of high-tech products to China. If the US sold four Ford-class aircraft carriers priced at $15 billion each, it would easily make up for a $ 60 billion trade deficit with China. A report released by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in April 2017 indicated that if the US were to liberalize its export barriers against China to the same level as those applicable to Brazil or France, the US trade deficit with China would be narrowed by up to 24 percent and 35 percent respectively. While keeping product design and marketing on its own territory, the US has been moving its processing and assembly lines overseas in recent decades, with China being the largest host country of this global industrial transfer. A large number of Chinese exports to the US are actually US-designed products manufactured in China. Chinese companies get paid by product manufacturing and they earn much less than the transnational companies. It is totally unfair to say China has gained more profits than the US. Instead of being an âeconomic aggressionâ, Chinaâs development provides great power for global economic growth. China has kept a contribution of about 30 percent to global economic growth since 2013, the first place in the world. In 2017, that figure reached 34.6 percent, almost twice of that of the US. Chinaâs development has also expanded the global market. From 2001 to 2017, the growth of goods imported by China rose by 13.5 percent on average, twice as fast as the global average. In the same period, the average growth of services in trade imported by China was 16.7 percent, 2.7 times of the global average. China is also an important job creator. It has co-built more than 80 economic and trade cooperation zones with Belt and Road countries, creating 244,000 local jobs. According to Ernst & Young, China has created more than 130,000 jobs in Africa from 2005 to 2016, tripling that done by the US. Between 1990 and 2016, China created 1.8 million jobs across Latin America and the Caribbean region, according to an International Labour Organization report titled ""Effects of China on the quantity and quality of jobs in Latin America and the Caribbean"". Some people in the US claime that China is âstealingâ American jobs, because some US factories have been moved to China. Indeed, the remarks arebiased and groundless. According to a 2017 US-China Business Council estimate, in 2015, US exports to China and US-China two-way investment supported 2.6 million jobs in America. A study by Ball State University found that America has lost more than 7 million factory jobs since manufacturing employment peaked in 1979, but the vast majority of the lost jobs â 88 percent â were taken by robots and other homegrown factors that reduce factoriesâ need for human labor. It proves that the American job loss has no connection with China. When expanding opening up, China has never taken the initiative to start a trade friction. Instead, it has comprehensively fulfilled its commitments to the World Trade Organization (WTO). China has increased assistance to developing countries, especially to the least-developed ones, in an effort to narrow the South-North development gap. By March 2018, it had accorded zero tariff treatment on 97 percent of all tariff lines to 36 least-developed countries that have diplomatic relations with China and completed exchange of notes. In 2018, China announced measures for further opening up and substantively lowered threshold for market access. It pledged to speed up in-depth and all-round opening up of the service sector, especially financial industry. Under the banner of âreciprocal opening upâ and excuse of abusing the ânational securityâ, the US has established the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which includes members of various departments, such as the intelligence department. The concept of ânational securityâ is constantly expanded to become a tool to block foreign companies to enter the US. In 2017, the CFIUS restricted more than 20 foreign companies, half of which were Chinese, from entering the US by the excuse of ânational securityâ. As WTO members, China and the US should solve economic and trade disputes under WTO framework. However, the US has ignored WTO dispute settlement mechanisms and arbitrarily handled foreign trade frictions by its domestic laws. Its behaviors run totally against the basic principles of the WTO, as well as its obligations of tariff reduction and the most-favored-nation treatment. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

[Photo/Agencies] Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook is on a trip to China this week, pledging to boost investment in Shanghai and strengthen communication with local mobile app developers. The move, amid the ongoing Sino-US trade frictions, underlines the importance of China, the world's largest mobile arena where Apple is locked in competition with rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. In a meeting with Shanghai Party Secretary Li Qiang on Tuesday, Cook said the US tech heavyweight will invest more in Shanghai and actively seek to expand cooperation, according to a report by Shanghai media. Such comments came after US President Donald Trump asked Apple to relocate part of its iPhone plants to its home turf, in order to avoid his proposed tariff on Chinese imports. However, such a move could lead to an iPhone price rise of as much as 20 percent, experts estimated. Currently, Apple has very strong ties with China where most of its manufacturing operations are located. The nation also accounted for around 18 percent of its total sales in the second quarter. Moreover, local developers are an essential part of Apple's ecosystem. It has also proposed plans to establish a string of research and development centers in China in two years, including the latest initiative announced in March to create a joint research facility with Tsinghua University to focus on advanced technologies, including machine learning and computer vision. But the US tech company is also facing a string of challenges, with Huawei and other local smartphone vendors working hard to erode its dominance in the premium segment. Cook, however, remains optimistic, saying he has never been as hopeful regarding the China market as he is now. He added in an interview with news portal Sina.com that the company's prowess in integrating software and hardware will give it an upper hand. During his trip, which started on Monday, Cook visited a number of local mobile app developers and users who are using Apple products. Such frequent communication highlights Apple's recognition of China's innovative capabilities and the importance of Chinese developers to the tech giant, said Zhao Ziming, an analyst at Beijing-based consultancy Analysys. Apple said there were around 1.8 million iOS Chinese app developers on its ecosystem last year. On Wednesday, Alipay, China's largest mobile payment platform, made the rare move of warning that its users making payments via Apple devices may face a risk of money loss due to possible security problems.

Ning, who's also head of the National Bureau of Statistics, said the rise of protectionism and unilateralism, as well as fluctuations in global financial and commodity markets, will inevitably affect China, as the country has already become highly integrated with the world economy since it promoted reform and opening-up 40 years ago. The economy, however, is on track to reach its annual growth target, which is evident from four major indicatorsï¼the overall economic growth rate, employment rates, prices and the balance of payments, Ning said in a recent interview. He said China enjoys the conditions, capability and confidence to meet the target of around 6.5 percent GDP growth for 2018. At the end of August, the country was 90 percent of the way to its goal of creating 11 million new jobs in urban areas this year. Ning made the comments as some indicators have shown signs of slower growth amid mounting China-US trade tensions. Noting fluctuations of the data were within a normal range, Ning said the economy will be resilient and sustainable in the third and fourth quarters, underpinned by the generally stable situation and the country's firm pace of reform and opening-up. On September 24, new US levies on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods came into force, followed by Beijing's tariffs on about $60 billion worth of US imports. Prior to that, both parties raised tariffs on $50 billion worth of each others' goods. The US tariff moves have a certain influence on China's economy, Ning said, but ""the overall impact is under control"". China has taken a series of measures to resolve the impact of the ongoing Sino-US trade dispute. ""China will continue to maintain steady momentum, advance structural reforms, promote high-quality economic development and seek progress,"" said the senior official. ""It will also maintain a stable performance in terms of employment, finance, foreign trade, investment and expectations,"" Ning added. Specifically, China endeavors to elevate the comfort level for companies, cut taxes and fees, expand employment and re-employment and boost domestic demand. It is also promoting coordinated development of the regional economy, deepening reforms, expanding opening-up, promoting trade with more foreign countries and facilitating foreign companies' entry to China and Chinese companies' expansion abroad. Ning noted that China has been giving great importance to risk prevention and steady growth. ""China's overall leverage level is not very high, but at a moderate level globally."" He added that the debt level of large industrial companies has steadily dropped in recent years. In late August, their average debt-to-asset ratio was at 56.6 percent, dropping 0.5 percentage point from a year earlier. Experts believe the government's recent adjustment toward a pro-growth stance can further fuel stable economic expansion. Wang Tao, an economist at banking group UBS, expects more policy easing, but the magnitude of easing will be designed to mainly offset any upcoming external shocks. Wang Yiming, vice-president of the State Council's Development Research Center, said that China should ramp up efforts to protect intellectual property, improve the mechanism for risk management and promote opening-up to boost quality growth.

In the first four days of the week-long National Day holiday which ended on Sunday, Chinese consumers have set new record highs in daily data, with more than 100 million people traveling across China and approximately one million Chinese taking leisure trips overseas, posting a tourism revenue of more than 100 billion yuan. In a longer perspective, the boost given by consumption to the Chinese economy has been significant. In the first half of the year, for instance, consumption contributed to 78.5 percent of the country's economic expansion, up 14.2 percentage points from the same period of last year. From January to August, China's total retail sales of consumer goods have exceeded 24 trillion yuan, with the monthly consumption exceeding three trillion yuan for four consecutive months. Meanwhile, the country's online retail sales rocketed by 28.2 percent to 5.52 trillion yuan during the first eight months, while the summer box office from June to August rose to 17.4 billion yuan. Lu Shan, a senior statistician with the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), said that China's consumption market has been expanding steadily. The growth of fixed-assets investment, another main engine of the Chinese economy, also showed new positive trends. On the whole, China's fixed-assets investment from January to August has grown at a slower rate of 5.3 percent, down by two percentage points from the same period last year. But in a breakdown analysis, NBS statistics showed the slowdown was mainly triggered by construction investment. Private investment, however, has expanded by 8.7 percent, 3.4 percentage points higher than the national average, while manufacturing investment has continued to rise for five consecutive months. As the slowdown in construction investment was mainly caused by the shortage of capital, the Ministry of Finance has urged local governments to speed up the issuance of special bonds of 1.35 trillion yuan to sustain the financing for projects under construction. NBS spokesperson Mao Shengyong said that a number of construction projects involving infrastructure facilities conducive to improving people's livelihood and enhancing the potential for economic development would be started soon. To stabilize investment, China wanted to channel capital into where it was most needed such as agriculture, poverty alleviation and environmental protection. As for exports, the third key engine of China's economic growth, China has become significantly less vulnerable to external uncertainties. Official statistics showed that the country's foreign trade dependence degree, the ratio of total amount of foreign trade to the country's gross domestic product (GDP), has fallen from 64 percent in the year 2000 to 33.5 percent in 2017. Only 19 percent of China's exports went to the U.S. in 2017. The 250-billion-USD Chinese exports subject to higher tariff duties imposed by the U.S. account for less than two percent of China's total GDP. Long Guoqiang, deputy director of the Development Research Center of the State Council, said that the risks from trade frictions with the U.S. were ""controllable"" to China's overall exports and China's economic growth. Fu Ziying, vice minister of commerce, said despite the trade frictions, stable progress was being made in China's foreign trade. Chinese products have so far been exported to 231 countries and regions. Five years after China proposed the Belt and Road (B&R) Initiative, the country's foreign trade with the B&R countries has exceeded 5.5 trillion U.S. dollars. Moreover, China posted a GDP growth rate of 6.8 percent in the first half of year, which has remained between 6.7 percent and 6.9 percent for 12 consecutive quarters. With more than 10 million new jobs created in the first eight month, the country has seen a relatively low surveyed urban unemployment rate of five percent. Consumer prices remained mild during the same period with a growth rate of 2 percent, while the foreign exchange reserve continued to stay strong, registering more than 3 trillion U.S. dollars at the end of September. With such sound economic fundamentals, the Chinese government has more maneuvering room to facilitate its economic transformation for high-quality development. On Sunday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) decided to cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for RMB deposits by one percentage point starting from Oct. 15 to optimize the liquidity structure of commercial banks and the financial market and to reduce financing costs. The PBOC said it will continuously implement a prudent and neutral monetary policy, refrain from using a deluge of stimulus and focus on targeted adjustment to maintain sound and sufficient liquidity. Some of the liquidity unleashed will be used to pay back the 450 billion yuan of the medium-term lending facility that will mature on Oct. 15. In addition, the liquidity of another 750 billion yuan will be injected into the market to support small and micro enterprises, private enterprises and innovative enterprises to enhance the vitality and resilience of the Chinese economy, strengthen endogenous growth momentum and promote the healthy development of the real economy, it said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

In the article, the paper summarized the fruits yielded from the construction of the initiative, and looked into the bright prospect of the proposal. The article was published on Thursday, five years after Chinese President Xi Jinping, on September 7 and October 3, 2013 respectively, put forward the proposal to co-construct the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. An abstract translation of the article is as follows: In 2018 when the world casts its eyes on China's achievements since it launched the reform and opening up policy four decades ago, it is more aware of the great importance of China's proposal to co-build the Belt and Road. The Belt and Road Initiative is not only an evident proof to China's efforts in deepening reform and expanding opening up in the new era, but also a concrete action of China to strengthen international cooperation and improve global governance. The initiative presents a satisfactory answer sheet since it was proposed five years ago. Opening to all the friends sharing the same aspiration, the initiative has earned increasing influence and attraction. Over 130 countries and international organizations have signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China, and the UN Security Council also called on the international society to intensify regional economic cooperation based on Belt and Road construction through the Resolution 2344 it passed. In addition, a total of 279 outcomes of five major categories came out of the first Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation China hosted last May. China's liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment has been greatly optimized as a result of the co-construction of the Belt and Road over the five years. China's trade with Belt and Road countries has exceeded $5 trillion and outward direct investment has amounted to over $60 billion, creating over 200,000 local jobs. It made China's outbound investment a key engine driving the global growth of outward direct investment. A series of big projects have been launched in countries and regions along the route in the five years. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the China-Mongolia-Russia economic corridor, for instance, are under smooth construction. The electrified rail project connecting landlocked Ethiopia to Djibouti, and the Mombasa-Nairobi standard gauge railway in Kenya have opened to traffic, while China-Laos Railway, China-Thailand high-speed railway, the Jakarta-Bandung rail line, as well as Belgrade-Budapest rail link have commenced construction. The China-Belarus Industrial Park, Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone (SSEZ) in Cambodia, as well as the Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone in Egypt have turned into models for industrial cooperation among on-route countries and regions. The construction work of Hambantota Port in southern Sri Lanka, Gwadar Port in Pakistan, as well as the Port of Piraeus in Greece go well. What's more, freight trains running between China and Europe have made over 10,000 trips to reach 43 cities in 15 European countries. Win-win cooperation has provided the public with a sense of gain, as the opportunities brought by the Belt and Road Initiative have broadened the development space of the businesses, created more jobs for citizens, and extended the consumption capability of the citizens. In today's world where the tide of trade protectionism and anti-globalization rise, the Belt and Road construction is offering the global economy precious impetus with its openness. Data from the World Bank showed that about 60 percent of the global economic output was contributed by the areas within 100 kilometers of the coast, while some countries, especially some landlocked ones, have constrained the globalization as they have been marginalized in the process. It has been more and more realized that the Belt and Road Initiative is the right remedy to the imbalanced development of the whole world. A well-recognized fact is that within the framework of Belt and Road cooperation, Asia, Africa, Latin America and some other developing regions are accelerating their pace in infrastructure construction to better share the development dividends of world economy. Experts estimated that global economy can grow 5 percent because of the globalization mainly driven by tariff cut in the past, but rise 10 percent to 15 percent thanks to the new type of globalization mainly spurred by connectivity. It is sad that someone affected by the expansion history of contemporary western world label the Belt and Road out of malicious intentions and cook up the so-called ""China threatsâ. ""Misunderstanding, or even distortion will take place if explaining China with the pure Western mindset,â said Zheng Yongnian, professor at National University of Singapore. As a matter of fact, there is no special requirements for the economic or political systems before joining the Belt and Road construction, which aims to maximize the development potential of all stakeholders. More countries and regions are now taking the Belt and Road construction as a big opportunity and trend of times to brace for a better future.ã (Guo Jiping is a well-known pen name used for People's Daily editorials meant to outline China's stance and viewpoints on major international issues.) var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

An analysis by the Centre for Economics and Business Research, an economic consultancy in London, concludes that US President Donald Trumpâs trade measures have already hit ï¿¡1.9 billion ($2.48 billion) of UK exports this year. The report is one of the first to highlight the global ramifications of the trade standoff between the US and China. âBritish goods â directly and through global value chains â consumer confidence and financial markets are particularly exposed to the escalation of protectionism across the globe,â Josie Dent, a member of CEBRâs economics team, wrote in the report, which she authored. Edward Tse, chief executive officer and founder of the management consultancy Gao Feng Advisory, said on Tuesday that the CEBR report makes clear that the trade disputeâs impact will be felt across the globe. âThis has to be expected. Supply chains have become so globalized and China is so much the center of world manufacturing, particularly in areas like consumer electronics, that every country that is in this chain will be affected,â he said. âThis is not just the UK, but South Korea, Japan, Malaysia and so on. The whole world is brought in by this.â The report by the CEBR, which is headed by its founder Douglas McWilliams, a former chief economist of the Confederation of British Industry, the UK industry body, said UK exports have been particularly damaged by the tariffs imposed on China because the United Kingdom is an integral part of the worldâs second-largest economyâs supply chain. On Sept 24, Trump enacted tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports on top of the $50 billion he had already imposed. Beijing immediately responded, slapping tariffs on 5,207 categories of US products worth $60 billion. The report said that the tariffs on Chinese goods alone have damaged about half of the ï¿¡3 billion of Chinese exports to the US that are originally sourced from the UK. In addition, the US tariffs imposed on European Union steel and aluminum exports in May have adversely affected ï¿¡389 million of UK exports, leading to a total impact on ï¿¡1.9 billion of exported goods. Dent said on Monday that because of the nature of global supply chains, the tariffs China placed on US goods have had a bigger impact than those imposed directly on the EU, of which the UK is a member. âA far greater impact on the UK comes through the escalating US-China trade war,â she said. Dent, who has done extensive research into global value chains, fears the situation can only deteriorate if Trump makes a further move. âIn the most recent round of the dispute, Trump warned that if China retaliated, then nearly all goods exported from China to the US could face additional duties. As China did indeed retaliate, the ball is back in Trumpâs court,â she said. Wang Huiyao, president and founder of the Center for China and Globalization, the leading Beijing-based independent think tank and a counselor to the State Council, Chinaâs Cabinet, said on Tuesday that the eventual effect of the trade measures will be felt globally. âIt certainly wonât just affect the UK, but many European countries and others too. I donât think people fully understand the complexity of this. If you take a company like Siemens, which makes SUV vehicles in the US, it will be impacted by tariffs both ways. Its exports to China will be hit, but also the components it sources from China.â Wang has just returned from the US presenting the Center for China and Globalizationâs own report, China-US Trade Relations and Challenges, at 20 events across the country. âAs the worldâs two largest economies, the US and China collectively account for almost half of global GDP, underwriting global prosperity. A trade war between the two will inevitably lead to a lose-lose outcome, harming not only both countries, but also the global economy at large,â that report concluded. Dent said that automakers in the UK are likely to be the worst hit by a trade war. Daimler has already announced that the tariffs on cars exported from the US to China contributed to its profits falling from â¬2.5 billion ($2.9 billion) in the second quarter of 2017 to â¬1.8 billion in the same period this year. âThe global nature of car production often means that components cross many borders before the final car is assembled. If each element faces a tariff at border crossings, costs will accumulate along supply chains,â she said. Dent said this could be particularly damaging to the UK economy since the auto industry made up 12 percent of exported UK goods. âThe UK car manufacturers will feel the impact of the trade war strongly, and the fall in profitability will hit the UK economy.â Dent said the trade dispute has already hit UK export growth, which has fallen from 14.2 percent year-on-year in the second quarter last year to 1.9 percent now. She said it has already also affected consumer confidence â the YouGov/Cebr UK consumer confidence index already fell notably when Trump announced his steel and aluminum tariffs â and she expects it to have a damaging effect on equity markets. â(The recent escalation) was already priced in by market players, though further escalations of the trade war are likely to have a negative impact (on stock markets),â she said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The average tariff rate will be reduced from 10.5 percent to 7.8 percent for these items, said the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council. The number accounts for 19 percent of the total taxable items. After the adjustment, China's overall tariff rate will stay at 7.5 percent, down from 9.8 percent last year. Such a rate is slightly higher than that of the European Union but lower than most developing countries, the commission said. The tariff cuts covered sectors including textiles, ceramics, steel, machinery and some resource-based products and primarily processed goods. Lowering tariffs to an appropriate level can promote balanced development of foreign trade and opening-up, the commission said. The move came after China provided zero tariffs on a majority of imported medicines starting May 1 and a reduction of tariffs on vehicles and auto parts as well as some consumer goods starting July 1. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

They even use their power to force others to accept their point of views. The US labels China with âunfair tradeâ, âintellectual property theftâ and other tags, and is trying to make hype through media reports. However, what the US fans up is not true. In the white paper âThe Facts and Chinaâs Position on China-US Trade Frictionâ released on Sept. 24, China has revealed the US misunderstandings . The US singles out the imbalance of trade in goods, and blames China for the imbalance. It doesnât see that the imbalance has evolved over time, and even turned a blind eye to the fact that the US ran a surplus in its trade with China from the 1980s to early 1990s. Nor did the US pay attention to its defects in economic structure, which can be manifested by the facts that the US was running trade deficits with 102 countries by 2017, and Chinaâs trade deficit with the US mainly lies in capital- and technology-intensive products. Moreover, 59% of Chinaâs trade surplus with the US was contributed by foreign-invested enterprises in China in 2017, and China has, to a large extent, taken over the trade surpluses of Japan, the Republic of Korea (ROK) and other East Asian economies with the US. Yet haunted by the cold-war mentality, the US imposes strict export controls on China, thereby limiting the potential of advantageous US exports. It complains that the âunequalâ openness of markets has led to âunfairâ trade, but turns a blind eye to the fact that the so-called âfair tradeâ is based on âAmerica firstâ, or the protection of Americaâs own interests. Even if we follow this absolute reciprocity logic of the US, unfair and non-reciprocal practices are more than common in the US. For example, Chinaâs tariffs on peanuts in the shell, dairy products and trucks are 15%, 12% and 15-25% respectively, while World Trade Organization (WTO) tariff figures show those of the US to be 163.8%, 16% and 25%, all higher than China. The US unjustly labels the technology transfer in the course of cooperation between China and developed countries as forced technology transfer, failing to see that establishment of partnerships with Chinese companies is a voluntary behavior initiated by the enterprises of developed countries keen to maximize their interests. In addition, the US side ignores that over the years, American firms in China have earned handsome profits through technology transfer and licensing. They are the largest beneficiary of technological cooperation. Since 2000, the total research and development (R&D) spend in China has registered an average annual growth rate of close to 20%. In 2017, China spent 1.76 trillion yuan in R&D, second only to the US. Chinaâs huge efforts and achievements with regard to intellectual property rights protection are also totally ignored by the US whoturns a deaf ear to the fact that more intellectual property cases, especially patent cases, are tried in China than in any other country and the adjudication period for foreign-related intellectual property cases in China is among the shortest in the world. China paid $7.96 billion in licensing fees to the US in 2016. Chinaâs payment of licensing fees and royalties for the use of foreign technology has recorded a four-fold increase over the last decade, reaching $28.6 billion in 2017 and ranking fourth in the world. Besides, the Chinese governmentâs encouragement to Chinese business to go global is distorted by the US as a government attempt to acquire advanced technologies through commercial merger and acquisition. However, from 2005 to 2017, only 17 out of 232 direct investments from China involved high technology, while others were mainly in real-estate, finance and services. Washingtonâs attack on Chinaâs subsidy policy shows its ignorance to the fact that subsidies are widely used by many countries and regions, including the US itself. Certainly, the US also shuts its eyes to Chinaâs conscientious compliance with WTO rules and its efforts to press ahead with reform to ensure the compliance of domestic policies. Is US slow on it, or selectively blind? When faced with problems, the US doesnât reflect on itself. Instead, it simply attributes the trade problems to China, because the latter is its largest source of trade deficit. What the US has told the world through its ignorance is that the American rules actually are self-centered and unreasonable. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

[Photo: fmprc.gov.cn] NEW YORK, Sept. 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday warned against the rising negative sentiment towards China in the United States. ""Many people who are committed to maintaining and promoting China-U.S. relations feel the cold wind blowing from behind, which should arouse the attention and vigilance of both sides,"" he said while meeting with Richard Haas, president of Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think tank, as well as other members of the council. He listed a few basic numbers to refute the claim by some people that the United States has suffered a huge loss in its economic and trade exchanges with China. ""In 2017, every U.S. farmer exported an average of more than 10,000 dollars of agricultural products to China; GM sells 4 million vehicles every year in China, exceeding its sales in the United States over the same period; in 2016, U.S.-owned enterprises achieved sales of over 600 billion dollars in the Chinese market. Now (they sell) definitely even more,"" he said. Wang said some people in the United States have accused China of rolling back its opening-up policy, and this is groundless. President Xi Jinping has repeatedly stated clearly that China will not its door to the world and will expand its opening, Wang said. The top Chinese diplomat pointed to the fact that China has taken the lead among developing countries in terms of the speed and scope of its opening-up effort. He cited China's opening-up in the service trade as an example. ""The World Trade Organization (WTO) has set up more than 160 sub-sectors that need to be opened. The developed countries in average opened 108 of them, while China opened 100 of them, far exceeding developing countries' average of 54."" As for tariffs, China's commitment to the WTO was to reduce the tariff to 10 percent and now it stands at 9.8 percent, Wang said, adding that the Chinese government has announced its decision to further reduce it to 7.5 percent as of Nov. 1. Particularly, China's tariff on agricultural products only stands at 15 percent, much lower than the average rate of 39 percent in the developed countries, he pointed out. With regard to foreign investment, he said China has been lowering the threshold for foreign investment and China's environment is increasingly favorable to foreign investment. Wang said China has never forced U.S. companies to transfer technology. The truth is U.S. companies voluntarily signed contracts with their Chinese partners to transfer technologies in order to access the Chinese market and those U.S. companies have also charged fees for such transfers. According to statistics, Chinese companies paid more than 28 billion dollars to foreign companies for the use of intellectual property last year, and in the first eight months this year, Chinese companies already paid 30 billion dollars for intellectual property, a large part of which went to the pockets of U.S. companies, said Wang. He said it is unfair for U.S. companies to blame China when they not only gained market shares in China, but also made money through technology transfers. Wang also reiterated China's stance on issues including the situation on the Korean Peninsula and in the South China Sea."

William Reinsch, the school chair in international business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the U.S. economy is benefiting right now from the tax cuts since the end of last year. But the fast growth will be offset by trade declines and higher consumer prices which will eventually change the momentum of economic growth. ""Most economists predict that the tax cut effect will begin to decline as well after a year or so and ultimately I think it will be a disaster because we have to pay for it eventually,"" said Reinsch. He also predicted that the impact of trade tension on American consumers will take some time to show up, adding ""the significant impact is not likely to occur until the first or the second quarter next year."" Talking about the impact on global economy, Reinsch said the trade friction will lower the global economic growth rate and at the same time have a spillover effect on protectionism. ""If one country breaks the rules, particularly a big one, and gets away with it, it becomes easier for others to do the same,"" Reinsch said. The United States has announced its decision to impose additional 10 percent tariffs on 200 billion U.S. dollars worth of Chinese products from Sept. 24, saying that it will take other escalating tariff measures.

It was the first negative FDI figure since the second quarter of 2014. The drop in FDI indicates that transnational corporations have suspended potential investment in the US, no doubt due to the tariff policy on imports and other trade policies implemented by the Trump administration.

Transnational firms have created more than 6.8 million jobs in the US through building factories and running businesses there. They have also boosted technological research and development in the US.

Businesspeople from the Midwest, also known as the âAmerican heartlandâ, and economists warned that Washingtonâs trade policy has hindered the regular cooperation between China and US states. The American business representatives expressed their concerns when attending the 2018 annual gala hosted by the China General Chamber of Commerce in Chicago recently. Business development manager Allen Williams of the Iowa Economic Development Authority said that the sharp fall of soybean prices due to the trade war has caused loss for Iowan farmers, and many of them were forced to divert to other crops. The trade frictions brought uncertainties to enterprises, said Colin Renk, executive director of America China Society of Indiana. Many enterprises established factories or supply chains in China as early as the 1980s, he noted, adding that these enterprises would like to see an end of the trade war and hope the two governments solve their problems through conversations. Many representatives agreed that the trade frictions will bring negative effects to the China-US cooperation, and a considerable number of enterprises would miss development opportunities. The uncertainty was a major issue brought by China-US trade frictions, said Jim Brady, chief operating officer of Grant Thornton, the world's sixth largest professional services network of independent accounting. He explained that the uncertainty would impact enterprisesâ investment decisions, which has already been indicated by the data from the China-US two-way direct investment. Stressing the vital importance of trade and investment for China-US ties, former US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson believed that both China and the US have benefited from them. He held that as consumption is rising to an increasingly powerful driver for Chinaâs economic growth, it will create huge opportunities for American exporters in the long run. In the eyes of the former Treasury Secretary, China is growing into a major investor, and is expected to create jobs for US communities. Todd Buchholz, renowned economist and former White House senior economic advisor illustrated the benefits brought to US citizens through trade with China with his own experience. The economist who was growing up in New Jersey recalled that there was no large-scale trade between China and the US in his childhood, and low-and middle-income families were always worried when they planned to buy winter coats for their children. Thanks to the development of the Chinese garment industry and the trade channel established between stores like Walmart and China, the winter coat issue wasnât a problem again, according to him. The negative impacts of the trade war would gradually show as time passes, Buchholz told Peopleâs Daily, adding that it was hard to precisely estimate the damage and tell who would become the winner. Most of the states in the Midwest have established close trade and economic relations with China. Representatives from these states stressed that they will maintain their passion for cooperation with China no matter how the federal government alters its policies. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

China is the Canadian lobster industry's second-largest export market behind the United States, which imported 50,787 metric tons of lobster from Canada in 2017. CHINA DAILY Canadian lobster has been well received in China in recent years, but now the industry may be suffering a fallout from the Sino-US trade row. Tariff cuts announced by China's Ministry of Commerce on Jan 1, 2017, were a boost to Canadian seafood exports to China. However, China placed a retaliatory 25 percent tariff on US lobster in July, which effectively shut down the fastest-growing market for Maine lobster. That in turn left the US lobster industry looking elsewhere to sell its productï¼including Canada and other Asian regions. Some Canadian lobster exporters told Canadian media that as US exporters lost the Chinese market, they are selling lobster in other parts of the world. Jack Liu, an operator for Zoneco, a large Chinese seafood company with a plant in Nova Scotiaï¼the main supply source of lobster shipped to Chinese mainlandï¼told Canadian media that in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Taiwan, American lobster is now ""selling cheaper, putting pressure on sales of Canadian lobster"". He believes Canadian lobster is ""losing market share in those Asian markets due to the lower price from the US"". Meanwhile, Canada reportedly is being used as a conduit or ""gray market"" into the Chinese market for Maine lobster. ""There have been indications that Maine lobster is coming into Canada and then being sent onward to China,"" Geoff Irvine of the Lobster Council of Canada told CBC News. ""Some of our live shippers are worried it could erode the Canadian market. It would undercut our market advantage in China and the prices we have, and we don't want that."" Canada and Maine have traded lobster across the border for many years. Companies that operate in Maine and Canada have been integrated into business supply chains. Maine lobster is typically used in Canadian lobster seafood-processing operations. Some Maine seafood companies have complained that there hasn't been the same number of buyers ordering lobster this harvest season, while some companies in Nova Scotia reported receiving more calls than usual from Chinese buyers. Because its air transport facilities aren't of the same scale as the US', Canada would send many of its lobsters to the US, which then exported them to other countries, including China. Canada's transportation infrastructure may not be able to handle additional traffic to meet the demands for lobster from China, according to exporters. China's increasing demand for lobster had helped the US industry, which had lost ground in European markets to Canada due to the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, which eliminated an 8 percent tariff for Canada's live lobster exports."

All of the furniture imported by Christianâs company is on the tariff list. âIt was a very sad day for me, and I was astonished,â he told Peopleâs Daily. Christian, coming from Nashville, Tennessee, started up a furniture company in Los Angeles in 1992. But due to high production cost, the company was closed in 2005 because its US-based production line lost the competition against imported furniture from Southeast Asia. After 5 years of exploration, Christian restarted his business and established a furniture design and assembling enterprise in Nashville, whose major business is to supply furniture for American schools and universities. He placed the designing department in the US and production base in China. Now his company ranks the second in the US in terms of school furniture. But the current escalation of the US tariff plan might bring bankruptcy to the businessman for a second time. He told Peopleâs Daily that it would totally destroy his business if the tariff went up to 25 percent from the next year. The man explained that it was impossible to reestablish a production line in other countries or to replace the cost-effective Chinese products with alternative ones in such a short time. âChinese products feature low price, high quality, high production efficiency and high transportation speed,â he noted, explaining that it was a result of Chinese factoriesâ advanced production equipment and Chinaâs first-class infrastructure. âThatâs why I choose China as my major source of supply,â he said. If the company gets shut down again, all Christianâs efforts for his new undertaking would be in vain. Nearly 400 US employees would lose their jobs, and the government would see decreased fiscal revenue. In addition, the price rise of school furniture would also bring damage to the higher education system, as the students will finally pay the costs. Feeling confused by the tariff decision of the US government, he told Peopleâs Daily that his business had no relation with the issue of intellectual property rights, and the furniture they imported from China was not patented. âWe design our products in the US, and our Chinese partners never have requested us to transfer the intellectual property rights,â he said. The tariff rise would put many US companies to death, and cause mass unemployment and bankruptcy of US households, he added. âWe work hard every day to offer the best furniture for schools,â Christian said, adding that it would be a heavy blow for himself, and an irony for all the hardworking Americans if they get bankrupt and laid off due to the tariff. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The document, titled âThe Facts and China's Position on China-US Trade Frictionâ, is Chinaâs official response to the excuses the US cited to initiate the trade war, the largest tariffs ever in history imposed by the US. The US claimed that it was a âloserâ in its trade with China and China forced the US into technology transfer, but the facts illustrated in the paper issued by the Information Office of Chinaâs State Council prove to be otherwise. US exports to China are growing much faster than its global average. UN statistics indicate that in 2017 US exports of goods to China amounted to $129.89 billion, a 577% increase from $19.18 billion in 2001 when China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO), and far higher than the 112% average growth rate of overall US exports. China did not steal US jobs, the white paper revealed. According to a US-China Business Council estimate, in 2015, 2.6 million jobs in America were supported by US exports to China and US-China two-way investment. Specifically, Chinese investment covered 46 states of the US, generating more than 140,000 jobs for the US, most of which were in manufacturing. In addition, products from China drove down commodity prices in the US and saved American households more money. According to the US-China Business Council, in 2015, trade with China saved every American family $850 of expenditure each year, equivalent to 1.5% of the average household income in the US. Besides, the US accusation of the so-called forced technology transfer by China cannot hold water either. Since 2000, the total R&D spend in China has registered an average annual growth rate of close to 20%. In 2017, China spent 1.76 trillion yuan in R&D, the second in the world, according to the white paper. Even US companies repeated that they had never been forced into technology transfer in China during the previous hearing sessions held to review the plans of imposing additional tariffs on Chinese goods. In other words, the âforced technology transferâ accusation was adopted to cover the fact that the US was the largest beneficiary of technological cooperation. According to the Peterson Institute, Chinaâs payment of licensing fees and royalties for the use of foreign technology has recorded a four-fold increase over the last decade, reaching $28.6 billion in 2017. Chinese statistics indicate that the US is the largest source of intellectual property imports to China. Chinaâs payments for US intellectual property doubled in six years from $3.46 billion in 2011 to $7.2 billion in 2017. In breakdown, Chinaâs intellectual property payments to the US accounted for a quarter of its total payments to foreign countries. The white paper also unveiled Uncle Samâs discrimination against foreign products, abuse of âNational Security Reviewâ as a way to obstruct the normal investment activities of Chinese companies in the US, large subsidies that distort market competition, the use of large-scale non-tariff barriers and the abuse of trade remedy measures. Many of these measures targeted China, said the paper, elaborating that from 2013 to 2015, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) reviewed in total 387 transactions concerning 39 economies, among which 74 were transactions involving investment from Chinese companies, accounting for 19% of the total, the largest share among all countries for three years in a row. According to the United States International Trade Commission, by July 17, 2018 there were 44 anti-dumping and countervailing policies in effect in the US, among which 58% were adopted after the 2008 financial crisis, with China, the EU and Japan as the main targets. The current US administration was always internationalizing domestic issues and politicizing economic and trade issues, the white paper pointed out. It erroneously attributed unemployment caused by domestic policy and institutional flaws to international trade, and blamed other countries for its own problems, the document added. China, as the biggest source of the US trade deficit, was a convenient primary target, stressed the paper. But the truth betrays what US has claimed. Statistics from the UN show that between 2001 and 2017, China-US trade has expanded by a factor of 4.41, and yet unemployment in the US dropped from 5.7% to 4.1%. Former US Secretary of Treasury Henry Paulson said in his book published in 2015 that the US adopted protectionist trade policies because its companies were worried about the âunfair competitionâ in the Chinese market, against the backdrop of US economic stagnancy and the widening gap between the rich and poor. Many Americans started to accept the wrong and dangerous opinion that the US didnât benefit from international trade, including its bilateral trade with China, he noted. The situation was worrisome in many aspects, especially in trade and investment. The two areas saw the closest economic ties between each other, but they were now being doubted and attacked, the book said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The measures aim to expand opening-up and foster a fairer, more convenient and more enabling environment for foreign investment. The Chinese government places high importance on foreign investment facilitation. Premier Li has emphasized on many occasions the pledge to widen market access, accord equal treatment to Chinese and foreign companies, more effectively protect intellectual property rights, and better facilitate foreign investments in China. It was decided at the Wednesday meeting that an online filing process will be introduced in regulating foreign investment in China. Unified market access criteria will be applied to both Chinese and foreign investment in areas outside of the negative list. Large-scale foreign investments eligible for major project development schemes will receive support on land and sea-use approval procedures and accelerated environmental impact assessment and their logistics costs will be reduced. More areas will be open to foreign investment. The withholding tax deferral policy for reinvestment by foreign investors in China will be expanded from the designated encouraged projects to any areas and projects that are not prohibited. The meeting also called for intensified protection of intellectual property rights. ""This year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up in China. Given the evolving situation at home and abroad, it is important to firmly commit to fostering greater opening-up and attracting foreign investment to help anchor market expectations,"" Li pointed out. Statistics from the Ministry of Commerce show that paid-in foreign investment reached 86.5 billion U.S. dollars between January and August 2018, a 6.1-percent increase year-on-year. More steps were approved at the meeting to cater for diverse consumer needs and facilitate industrial upgrading. Starting from Nov. 1 this year, import tariffs for a total of 1,585 tax items will be slashed. The average tariff rate for highly demanded products in domestic markets such as machinery and industrial instruments will be cut from 12.2 percent to 8.8 percent, textile and construction materials from 11.5 percent to 8.4 percent, paper and some other resource-based products and primarily processed goods from 6.6 percent to 5.4 percent. Tax brackets will be consolidated for goods in the same or similar categories. Tariff cuts introduced to date will help reduce corporate and consumer tax burdens by nearly 60 billion yuan (about 8.7 billion U.S. dollars) and lower China's overall tariff rate from 9.8 percent last year to 7.5 percent. More efforts will be made to expedite customs clearance. The meeting decided that by November 1 this year, the number of customs clearance documents subject to verification at ports will be reduced from 86 to 48. The list of administrative charges at ports will be released before the end of October this year. Compliance costs of containers clearing will be will be reduced by at least 100 U.S. dollars by the end of this year. Overhaul of fees must be completed without delay in order to abolish unreasonable charges and cut compliance costs, Li urged at the meeting.

Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi [Photo:fmprc.gov.cn] Wang made the remarks at a meeting here with representatives from the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations and the U.S.-China Business Council, during which they exchanged views on such issues as China-U.S. relations and bilateral economic and trade cooperation. Wang said that China and the United States are the world's largest developing country and developed country respectively; the two nations are also top two economies around the globe and both are permanent members of the UN Security Council. Noting the two countries are going to usher in the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, Wang said the most important experience gained by the two sides in the past 40 years is that only through cooperation can a win-win situation be attained, and confrontation will certainly lead to a lose-lose scenario. The two sides must unswervingly move towards in the direction of cooperation, especially when encountering problems and disturbance, said Wang. Wang pointed out that recently, negative postures of the U.S. policy on China are on the rise. Some forces have repeatedly and groundlessly blamed China in such fields as economy, trade and security, creating sentiments of opposition and poisoning the relationship atmosphere. The accusations toward China are not true and irresponsible; if left unchecked, they will destroy the achievements of China-U.S. relations in the past 40 years, which is unfavorable for the two countries as well as the international community, said Wang. China always advocates that any problem between China and the United States can be resolved through equal and frank dialogue, he said. Wang said that the Chinese and the U.S. economies are highly integrated, and bilateral economic and trade cooperation has brought huge benefits to industries and customers of both sides. To cut off the economic relationship between China and the United States, which has been claimed by some people, is unrealistic and harmful, he said. China and the United States are the largest emerging market and the biggest mature market respectively, said Wang, adding that the Chinese market is related to the livelihood of every U.S. family. If the two sides can cooperate with each other actively, the U.S. economy can attain lasting vitality from the Chinese market, and China can promote its development through the U.S. market, Wang said. As for questions about China's market access, China's reform and opening-up as well as structural adjustment of its economy, Wang stressed that China will firmly deepen reforms and expand opening-up to the outside world. China's development has benefited from its reform and opening-up, and the pursuit of further openness is in need of China's development, said Wang. After its entry into the World Trade Organization, China reduced the average tariff level to 9.8 percent, over-fulfilling its tariff reduction commitments. And the tariff level is below the average of developing countries, Wang noted. The number of sub-sectors opened by China in service trade market has reached 100, far exceeding the average number of 54 of developing countries and approaching the level of developed nations, he said. China has implemented local record filing management for over 96 percent of foreign investments and has been implementing a management system of pre-entry national treatment plus a negative list, with the list shortened for foreign investments, said Wang. Wang said currently, China is seeking development of high quality, and deepening structural reform is part of the endeavor. Chinese President Xi Jinping has stressed many times that China's door of opening-up will only become wider, and a series of new measures have been and will be continuously launched, Wang noted. Yet China is still a developing country and it needs to advance the process of reforms based on its national conditions in an orderly and self-determined manner, he added. Wang pointed out that China has no intention of seeking a trade surplus and is willing to resolve trade imbalances through consultations. However, dialogue should be built on equality and integrity and cannot be carried out under threats or pressure, Wang said. The U.S. side launched a larger scale of unilateral tariff-slapping action in the run-up to a new round of dialogue, which indicates that the United States has no sincerity to solve the problem, he said. Wang thanked members of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations and the U.S.-China Business Council for making long-term efforts in promoting cooperation between the two countries. He also expressed his hope that they can play a positive role in healthy development of China-U.S. relations and win-win cooperation between the two sides. Representatives from the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations and the U.S.-China Business Council said good relations between the United States and China are in the fundamental interests of both sides. Over the past 40 years, both the United States and China have benefited greatly from bilateral relations and cooperation between the two sides, said the representatives. Most people from U.S. business circle do not agree to solve the current problem by slapping tariffs, and the rhetoric and actions to try to regard China as a hostile force is wrong, said the representatives. The United States and China need to strengthen dialogue, particularly at this moment, enhance mutual understanding and solve problems in development of bilateral relations through consultations, they said. In the long run, the two sides need to transcend specific issues such as trade, and conduct strategic communication on the long-term development of bilateral relations, they added. The U.S. side said that the U.S.-China economic and trade cooperation has been a stabilizing force for bilateral relations for a long time, and the U.S. business circle has been a firm supporter for U.S.-China relations. The U.S. business circle sincerely hopes to resolve structural problems in bilateral economic and trade relations through pragmatic dialogue and constructive ways including promoting discussion and signing of bilateral investment agreements, said the U.S. side. The National Committee on U.S.-China Relations and the U.S.-China Business Council are willing to continuously play a role in promoting the development of bilateral relations on a right track, the U.S. side added."

China to open its doors to all LNG suppliers, official says As Sino-US trade tensions escalate, China said it will open its doors to all suppliers of liquefied natural gas around the world. The trade war between China and the United States has brought damage to the global value chain and exerted a negative impact on normal trade, Vice-Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen said at the press conference. Wang said the US can be an important supplier for China's liquefied natural gas, but because Washington has adopted trade restrictions, China has to take countermeasures. China, as a huge market, is willing to further open up and will give opportunities to all LNG suppliers around the globe, he said. He added Australia is an important source of LNG for China, and the two sides have a large amount of trade with great potential.

When to restart the Sino-US high-level economic and trade talks depends entirely on the US, Vice-Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen said at a press conference. Wang said the Chinese side is open to resolving economic and trade differences through negotiations. But effective negotiations need the two parties to respect each other in an equal manner. One needs to be sincere in negotiations and follow its promise, he stressed. Sino-US high-level talks have been carried out for four rounds and achieved some consensus. The US, however, has went back on its words and adopted trade restrictions, Wang added. Impact of new US tariffs manageable, says official The fresh tariffs of the United States on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods can have inevitable impact on the economy but the risks are controllable, an official said. Lian Weiliang, vice-minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, said at a press conference that the US latest tariff move can have direct and indirect influence on the economy with certain industries and regions being affected to a greater degree. Although the impact is inevitable, the risks are generally under control, Lian said. The Chinese economy is fully capable of hedging the impact by expanding domestic demand to promote high-quality development, he stressed."

The document was released as a new round of tariff hikes between the two sides took effect amid growing concern over undermining global growth. On Monday, new US levies on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods came into force, followed by Beijing's new tariffs on about $60 billion worth of US imports. It showed that Sino-US tariff tensions that had grown for the past several months had hit a new high point, observers said. On the same day, China released the white paper â The Facts and China's Position on China-US Trade Friction â which aims to clarify facts about the bilateral economic and trade relations and demonstrate China's stance. It said US President Donald Trump's administration has trumpeted his ""America First"" slogan since 2017 and has abandoned the fundamental norms of mutual respect and equal consultation that guide international relations. Rather, it has brazenly preached unilateralism, protectionism and economic hegemony, making false accusations against many countries and regions, particularly China, intimidating other countries through trade measures such as imposing tariffs and attempting to impose its own interests on China through extreme pressure, according to the white paper. China has been dealing with these differences by seeking common ground while shelving divergences. The US, however, has been contradicting itself and constantly challenging China, which caused serious damage to bilateral trade ties and poses a grave threat to the multilateral trading system, the paper said. Yu Yongding, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that as the white paper says, the real trade imbalance between the two sides is not as big as what the US claimed it to be, as statistical methods and standards vary. China should not be blamed for the US trade deficit, which is actually rooted in the latter's low savings rate and its economic structure as a high-end manufacturer, Yu said. The white paper cited World Bank data as showing that the dependence of the global economy on trade growth has increased from 17.5 percent in 1960 to 51.9 percent in 2017. China-US tariff measures have added drag to world economic prosperity, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The organization projects that the global economy will grow by 3.7 percent in both 2018 and 2019. ""Trade tensions are starting to bite and are already having adverse effects on confidence and investment plans,"" said OECD Chief Economist Laurence Boone. ""Trade growth has stalled, restrictions are having marked sectoral effects and the level of uncertainty on trade stances remains high."" China's white paper said the country's door will not be closed, but increasingly opened wider, reiterating that the country has not forced foreign companies to transfer their technologies. In 2017, China's total spending on research and development hit 1.76 trillion yuan ($257 billion), ranking second globally, said the white paper. Mei Xinyu, a researcher at the International Trade and Economic Cooperation Institute of the Ministry of Commerce, said: ""It is necessary for China to continue reforming the domestic economic system. Only in this way can we effectively shift the momentum of economic growth to be driven by indigenous innovation and domestic demand.""

Rising trade tensions between the US and the rest of the world could cost the global economy $430 billion, with America âespecially vulnerableâ to an escalating tariff war, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned in a recent study. ""Our modeling suggests that if current trade policy threats are realized and business confidence falls as a result, global output could be about 0.5 percent below current projections by 2020,"" the Washington-based organization said in an earlier report. Beyond the immediate threat from weaker levels of international trade, the organization believed wider use of protectionist measures would hinder business investment, make tradable goods less affordable, disrupt global supply chains, and slow the spread of new technologies, thus lowering productivity. A tariff escalation, coupled with a shock to investor confidence, could reduce global exports and global income with losses across all regions, said a latest World Bank report. The tariffs slapped by the US administration would make products of American companies more expensive, costing them sales, Washington Post said in a recent commentary. âBusiness leaders are warning the high-stakes strategy could upend their supply chains and raise costs, as economists worry Trump's tactics could derail the broadest global upswing in years,â Bloomberg reported. China's trade surplus with the US is neither an evidence to put China in the name of âunfair tradeâ, nor a reason for the falling employment and other economic losses of the US, according to Donald J. Boudreaux, a professor of economics at George Mason University. In a world with more than two countries, there was no reason to expect a completely âbalancedâ trade between a pair of partners, the professor pointed out, adding that the trade deficit of the US against other economies was a sign of its wrong decision, but is more than that. The US economy would benefit rather than suffer from more investments from other countries on its territory, Boudreaux stressed, suggesting the US resort to bilateral or multilateral trade talks if it really hoped to resolve the trade frictions with other economies. âHistory tells us that unilateral trade protectionism move will never make others compromiseâ, he stressed. The US government believed that de-globalization of American economy would revitalize its manufacturing and create more jobs, but as a matter of fact, its trade policy would only damage global supply chain, said Charles P. Freeman, a senior fellow at Brown University's Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. The global supply chain was a cross-border production line that could generate better quality of consumer goods at lower prices, he said, adding that the US was a beneficiary of the global supply chain itself. In the full-blown trade wars, when major economies clash, developing countries would be the hardest hit, Mukhisa Kituyi, Secretary-General of the UN Conference on Trade and Development wrote in an article, citing an African proverb, âWhen elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers.â âSince the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade took effect in 1947, the average value of tariffs in force around the world has declined by 85%. That is no coincidence; rather, it is the result of multilateral cooperation , and eight rounds of global trade negotiations,â he added. Kituyi concluded that a global trade war might jeopardize the multilateral trading system itself, and its effects would be felt everywhere, especially in the world's poorest countries. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The action was later followed by China's countermeasure to impose additional tariffs on about $60 billion worth of American products. What are the impacts of the latest US tariff decision on China? To be objective, the largest impact brought by the US-initiated trade war would be shouldered by its export to the US, and to impose higher tariffs on imported commodities from the US may also increase burden for Chinese downstream enterprises and consumers. Will China be able to withstand the trade war? Former governor of the People's Bank of China Zhou Xiaochuan seemed positive on the current situation. He said on Sept. 7 that the trade war would not cause huge negative impact on China's economy. Zhou predicted that the impact of trade friction on China's GDP would be less than half a percent, citing a calculation based on mathematical model. Based on evaluation by professor Wei Jie at Tsinghua University, only 10 percent of China's economy depended on export in 2017, reducing from 70 percent in 2007, and the country's export to the US accounted for only one third of its total export. Wei's figures also supported the prediction that the trade war would not place huge impact on China's GDP. However, Zhou warned that the trade war would affect China's market sentiment, and will likely weaken investors' confidence in Chinese enterprises and stock market. He elaborated that what China really needed to stay alert against was the âMinsky Momentââthe collapse of asset value in the eyes of economist Hyman Minsky. Minsky believed that a long period of stable economy might lead to an increase of debts and a higher leverage ratio, causing financial crisis from inside and dragging the country into long-term deleverage. In other words, what China needs to do in face of the trade war is to well handle its own business. China is the world's largest manufacturer and the only country engaged in all the industrial classifications listed by the UN. Given such advantage, China has no reason to fear the extreme trade measures that the US takes during the trade war, and these measures will only result in a large-scale cut-off of its own domestic supplies. In addition, China should take the trade conflict as an opportunity to promote import substitution, domestic manufacturing and export-oriented advanced manufacturing, rather than worry about higher domestic commodity prices caused by its countermeasures. The bulk cargos imported from the US have a low share on Chinese market, and most of these imports are primary commodities that can be easily replaced. Under such circumstances, China's countermeasures would not bring huge impact on the supply of related commodities, manufacturing, or employment. The trade war is a wake-up call for China as it has exposed the country's problems including inadequate core technologies, financial security risks and domestic social crisis. To solve these problems, China must further deepen reform and opening up, find a solution to underlying problems, and seek opportunities for growth amid the ""crisis"". var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

In a statement issued Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that his government would impose 10-percent tariffs on roughly 200 billion U.S. dollars' worth of imports from China starting on Sept. 24, and expand the levy to 25 percent beginning Jan. 1. Part of Washington's rationale for this is the belief that its tariff tactics will have grueling consequences for the Chinese economy; as such, China would agree to make more concessions -- only to play into Washington's hands. However, this U.S. assumption is based on a lack of understanding of China's economy and policies. With an annual decline in the share of foreign trade in the whole Chinese economy, China is consolidating the fundamental role that domestic consumption plays in its growth. In the first half of 2018, China's gross domestic product increased by 6.8 percent, overshadowing that of most major economies in the world. Domestic consumption contributed 78.5 percent to the growth rate. Meanwhile, Beijing is continuing to steadily promote a reform and opening-up and adopting measures to stabilize the market. China's stable environment for foreign investment, measures to facilitate business, transparent policies along with a vast consumer market continue to make it a coveted target for global businesses, all adding up to its confidence in confronting Washington's unilateral and protectionist moves. China's policies on trade facilitation and investment liberalization, in sharp contrast to the U.S. strategy, have been well received around the globe. U.S. multinationals such as Tesla and ExxonMobil have announced huge investment programs in China recently, casting ballots of confidence in favor of Beijing. In fact, Washington's approach of imposing tariffs will not solve the China-U.S. trade disputes, but harm the interests of U.S. businesses and consumers instead and add downside risks to the global economy. The latest report by the American Action Forum, a Washington-based nonprofit issue advocacy organization, showed that the upcoming tariffs could raise overall costs for both U.S. consumers and businesses by roughly 19.7 billion dollars per year. In a letter to the U.S. Trade Representative by 150 industrial associations earlier this month, the organizations representing agriculture, retailers, manufacturers, technology and other industries say that ""continuing the tit-for-tat tariff escalation with China only serves to expand the harm to more U.S. economic interests, including farmers, families, businesses and workers."" On the ground, unilateral tariff onslaughts have never prevailed in U.S. history.

The Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council unveiled lists of 3,571 items of U.S. products to be subject to additional tariffs of 10 percent, and lists of another 1,636 items to be subject to additional tariffs of 5 percent. The new tax rates will take effect at 12:01 p.m. Beijing time on Sept. 24, said the commission. The willful decision of the U.S. government has led to the escalation of trade friction between the two countries. China was forced to take countermeasures in defense of free trade and multilateral system, and its own legitimate rights and interests, the commission said in a statement. If the U.S. side continues to do so, China will respond in kind, it added. China has no choice but to respond to the U.S. unilateralism and trade protectionism with tariffs in order to stem the friction from escalating. China hopes the U.S. side will stop frictions from expanding and jointly safeguard bilateral trade ties with China through equal, honest and pragmatic dialogue, on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefits, said the statement. That will also serve to defend the free trade principle and multilateral trade system, and global economic prosperity and development, it said. The United States, disregarding overwhelming international and domestic opposition, announced to impose additional 10-percent tariffs on 200 billion U.S. dollars worth of Chinese products from Sept. 24 and that it will take other escalating tariff measures. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

A national lobbying campaign called ""Tariffs Hurt the Heartland"" has been announced by Americans for Free Trade, a new coalition of more than 80 US trade associations and the Farmers for Free Trade, the coalition backed by the nation's largest agriculture industry groups on Wednesday. Aiming to oppose Trump administration's tariffs on imported products, the campaign will explain the tariff planâs negative impacts on US businesses, farmers, workers and families through various forms of media such as social media and digital advertisement. The campaign will start in Chicago, Nashville, Pennsylvania and Ohio the next week, and additional activities will take place in the next two months in key communities throughout the US heartland. The event organizers put an interactive map on its website named âTariffs Hurtâ that allows users to find stories of job losses, deferred investments, higher prices and other negative consequences by clicking each state on the map. Before this, many American business associations submitted thousands of pages of documents to the office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) during public hearing sessions, to oppose the White Houseâs plan to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. âInstead of seeing our proposals reviewed, we waited only to find harsher tariff measures taken at a more rapid speed, which made us very worried,â said David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation, who added that the trade coalition was set up at the right time to cope with the increasingly severe situation. Americans for Free Trade represents thousands of companies in industries including planting, forestry, fishery, energy, retail, chemical, machinery manufacturing, clothing, transportation, Internet and information technology, as well as commercial and trade services. ""Every sector of the US economy stands to lose in a trade war,"" National Retail Federation President and CEO Matthew Shay said in a statement. âThe stakes couldnât be higher for American families, businesses, farmers and workers threatened by job losses and higher prices as a result of tit-for-tat tariffs.â ""That's why a diverse coalition of industries is banding together to amplify the voices of Americans and ensure Washington to understand the real-world consequences of a trade war."" he stressed. A commentary of US National Broadcasting Company (NBC) said the White House took tariffs as a powerful tool for negotiation, attempting to achieve trade agreements for better benefit of all Americans. But most economists respond that trade deficit cannot always be unfavorable, and it is even not an effective indicator to evaluate a countryâs economic health condition, because trade deficit could to some extent reflect economic vitality and resilience of the currency, as well as cut import costs. Donald J. Boudreaux, economics professor of George Mason University, told Peopleâs Daily that the rising tariffs could bring damages to US companies which relied on importing raw materials for production. The tariffs would make those so-called âprotectedâ American enterprises unable to effectively allocate their recourse, leading to a waste of resources, he elaborated. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

[Photo/China Daily] China's consumer inflation picked up more than expected in August, mainly driven by food price increases due in part to seasonal factors. Amid worries about inflation pressure caused by African swine fever and tariff tensions with the United States, there are no major concerns for significant inflation pressure in the coming months, pointing to mild inflation toward the end of this year, according to analysts and officials. The consumer price index, a main gauge of inflation, rose 2.3 percent year-on-year in August, up from 2.1 percent in the previous month, the largest increase since February, according to the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday. China is aiming to keep annual CPI growth at around 3 percent this year. NBS statistician Sheng Guoqing attributed the higher than expected CPI growth to higher food prices in August that have been pushed up by adverse weather and the relatively limited supply of pork. Food prices went up by 2.4 percent year-on-year in August, according to Sheng. Those prices jumped in August as hot, wet weather and an outbreak of swine fever in some regions decreased supplies of vegetables and pork, while seasonal factors also led to some price increases, Haitong Securities analysts Jiang Chao and Li Jinliu wrote in a note. ""We expect CPI in September to increase slightly to 2.5 percent year-on-year, led by a continued rise in pork prices and moderate growth of prices of vegetables and fruits,"" they said. The producer price index grew by 4.1 percent year-on-year in August, which is 0.5 percentage points slower than in the previous month, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The latest data come as worries of possible stagflation have emerged amid rising expectations for continued inflation and downward economic pressure. Stagflation is characterized by slower economic growth and increased inflation. Nevertheless, no signs have appeared to indicate a continued rise of inflation pressure, nor is the economy facing a hard landing later this year, according to a National Development and Reform Commission official who declined to be identified. Despite some downward pressure ahead, the government is not likely to proceed with a major policy easing to fend off financial risks, which means the monetary environment does not point to a sharp increase in inflation, according to the official. As for additional tariff threats by the United States, the overall pressure remains by far under control, reflected by a monthly decline in edible oil prices in August despite a drop in soybean imports, according to Wang Qing, chief economist with Golden Credit Rating. The two countries have already slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on $50 billion worth of goods, and the US is eying additional tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports.

Chinese importers have gradually shifted to domestic producers and products from other countries in an effort to replace US soybeans due to the rise in price. China is the worldâs largest soybean consumer, and over 80 percent of its soybeans are imported. Brazil and the US, two major sources of soybeans for China, contributed to more than 60 percent of Chinaâs annual soybean imports. Heilongjiang-based Jiusan Group, a major soybean processing enterprise, handles about 12 million tons of soybeans each year. About 8 million tons of soybeans processed by the company were imported, in which the US soybeans accounted for 40 percent. However, Jiusan Group halted purchase from the US since the second half of 2018. According to Zhang Lichen, vice president of the company, the price of US soybeans was at least 700 to 800 yuan ($102 to $117) higher than before since the 25 percent tariff came in effect. Enterprises expanded imports from South America and are trying to enlarge imports from Canada and Russia as a countermeasure, Zhang explained. He cited imports from Brazil as an example, saying that the portion of soybeans from Brazil had been raised to around 65 percent from the original 50 percent. Chinese enterprises basically stopped imports of soybeans from the US since this July. As a result, Russia and Canada, who have been optimistic about the Chinese market, are planning to increase exports of soybeans to China. âThe Chinese market is huge, and we donât think too much about the ongoing changes in international trade patterns,â said the general manager of a Russian agricultural complex in Amur Oblast. The rising price of the crop also enhanced the competitiveness of domestic soybeans which were at a competitive disadvantage. It has been confirmed that since the end of April this year, the Heilongjiang government has raised subsidies for soybean growers from 200 to 210 yuan per mu (0.067 hectare) to further encourage soybean production. Insiders predicted that the increased subsidy will help expand to nearly 10 million mu of soybean plantations, making the national total increase to 127 million mu. In general, Chinaâs soybean supply will maintain stable, and the high dependence on foreign countries will be relieved. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The current US business community is increasingly anxious about the escalation of the China-US trade war. These four tech firms pointed out in a letter to the US Trade Representative (USTR) that adding tariffs on network equipment will increase the price paid by consumers and cause a delay in investment, which may lead to job losses for workers and diminishing dividends to shareholders.

Despite concerns over the impact of the Trump administration's trade policy on their own businesses, few leaders of large US companies have so far expressed their opposition directly and openly.

(Xinhua/Jiang Kehong) China's foreign trade registered steady growth in the first eight months of this year despite higher tariffs imposed by the United States, official data showed Saturday. China's goods trade went up 9.1 percent year on year to 19.43 trillion yuan (about 2.85 trillion U.S. dollars) in the first eight months of this year, the General Administration of Customs (GAC) said. Exports rose 5.4 percent year on year in the January-August period to 10.34 trillion yuan while imports grew 13.7 percent to 9.09 trillion yuan, resulting in a trade surplus of 1.25 trillion yuan, which narrowed by 31.3 percent, according to the GAC. In August, exports rose by 7.9 percent, higher than 6 percent in July. August's data was widely watched as it was the first reading since fresh U.S. tariffs on 16 billion U.S. dollars worth of Chinese imports went into effect. Beginning August 23, the United States slapped an extra 25 percent tariff on 16 billion U.S. dollars worth of Chinese imports, to which China responded with an equivalent retaliatory measure. The move came after additional tariffs on 34 billion U.S. dollars worth of Chinese imports went into effect on July 6. Saturday's data showed that China's exports have not deteriorated so far with strong export volume supporting total value, China Merchants Securities said in a research note. The country's trade with major trading partners saw an increase during the January-August period. Trade with the European Union, its largest trading partner, climbed 6.2 percent, and trade volume with the United States and ASEAN countries increased by 5.9 percent and 11.8 percent, respectively. Trade with countries along the Belt and Road totaled 5.31 trillion yuan, up 12 percent year on year, 2.9 percentage points faster than the average growth rate, data showed. Saturday's data also revealed a more balanced trade picture, with imports in August continuing the rapid expansion seen in previous months. In August, imports jumped by 18.8 percent in yuan terms, slightly lower than the 20.9-percent rise seen in July. China's imports of consumer goods such as food and cosmetics have seen rapid growth since 2017, while domestic demand related to manufacturing investment remained robust, indicating that China's imports are less relevant to infrastructure and real estate investment, China Merchants Securities said. China has been seeking a more balanced trade pattern, with a series of pro-import policies introduced. Earlier in July, China's State Council released guidelines on expanding imports, promising tariff cuts, clean-ups of unreasonable price mark-ups, and better intellectual property rights protection. Fast growth in imports has helped bring down China's trade surplus, which stood almost flat in August compared with July in dollar terms, China Merchants Securities said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The statement was made in response to the possible imposition of additional tariffs by the U.S. on 200 billion U.S. dollars worth of imported Chinese goods. The public comment period in the U.S. of additional tariffs on the above-mentioned amount of Chinese imports recently ended and the majority of participants opposed the move. ""If the U.S. side ignores the opposition of the majority of enterprises participating in the public comment, and goes its own way to impose additional tariffs on more Chinese imports, China will have to take necessary countermeasures,"" said Gao Feng, the MOC spokesperson, at a press briefing. China reiterates that any attempts to pressure China are unreasonable and futile. The trade war will not solve any problems. Equal and sincere dialogue and negotiations are the only correct ways to solve China-U.S. trade disputes, said Gao. After the U.S. announcement of a plan to impose additional tariffs on 200 billion dollars worth of Chinese imports, China announced countermeasures on Aug. 3 to impose additional tariffs on U.S. imports of 60 billion dollars and released the list of the U.S. products. Over the past few months, the U.S. has seriously violated the World Trade Organization rules, incessantly introduced unilateral policies and led to the continuous escalation of bilateral trade frictions, which not only damaged businesses and consumers' interests in both countries, but also undermined the global industrial chain and value chain, Gao said.

At the end of a long list of potential tariff targets by the Trump administration sits a handful of peculiar items, including ""paintings, drawings and pastels, executed entirely by hand, whether or not framed"", and ""antiques of an age exceeding 100 years"". The US Office of the Trade Representative in Washington concluded public hearings last week on a proposed 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, including artwork and related items. The last day to file appeals and comments is Thursday, and the new tariffs could take effect within a week. Hundreds of comments were posted on the website regulations.gov regarding the art tariffs. From a cross-section of respondents, there seems to be a common thread that the measure will have an unintended effect, namely boxing out US dealers, auction houses and museums, and actually helping similar businesses in China, where the market for Chinese art is voracious. Also, instead of burdening Beijing, the tariffs could help the Chinese government, which has moved to keep Chinese art within the its borders. Since 1949, China has prohibited the export for sale of any artwork produced before 1912 without permission from National Cultural Heritage Administration. The tariff would also apply to any artwork produced in China, even if it is currently in other countries or owned by foreign buyers. ""A Chinese antique vase that has been in France for the past 50 years and imported into the US for sale or exhibition would be subjected to the tariff despite its long tenure outside China,"" wrote Lena Wong, posting on behalf of auction houses Sotheby's and Christie's. In 2009, the US and China signed a memorandum of understanding that restricted importation into the US of cultural and archaeological materials from the Paleolithic period through the Tang Dynasty (75,000 BC-AD 907), as well as monumental sculptures and wall art at least 250 years old. ""Following the imposition of the agreement between the US and China in 2009, the domestic Chinese market for Chinese art and antiquities grew 500 percent. Therefore, it is only reasonable to believe that any further restrictions on US market access to Chinese art and antiquities would be of benefit to China and Chinese art businesses, and not to the US or any of its art market participants,"" she wrote. James J. Lally, whose Manhattan gallery specializes in Chinese art such as ceramics wrote: ""In fact, the PRC is the world's largest market for Chinese artï¼their internal market for ancient Chinese art is many times larger than the US market. The negative effect of the proposed tariff on ancient Chinese art would only fall on consumers and dealers in the US."" Dessa Goddard of Berkeley, California wrote that buyers from China ""already constitute between 70-80 percent of successful buyers in US Chinese art auction house sales, prompted by the growth of spending power among collectors and of major auction houses within China"". ""Together they constitute the strongest demand and market for their own heritage. The imposition of an exorbitant 25 percent tariff on the importation of China-origin art will seriously impair strong American competition for Chinese works of art, enhancing the already seemingly one-way traffic of Chinese art back to China."" The tariffs will affect galleries of all sizes and levels of prestige, as well as supply stores. Vicky Konecky owns a small fiber arts supply shop in Tucson, Arizona. ""I know that the increase in the tariff will have a devastating effect on my business,"" she wrote. ""Most of our needles, hooks, accessories and much of our yarn, as well as fiber, comes from China. We already are struggling to stay in business with the competition from internet businesses, and having to raise our prices to compensate for the increase in costs will further hurt our business."" Patricia Graham of Colorado, a member of the Appraisers Association of America for Chinese, Japanese and Korean art, said the tariff ""will significantly hurt US collectors and museums"", and many works of art from China in US museum exhibitions are on loan. ""These are not for sale, so they are not subject to the proposed tariffs. But what happens if the artworks get imported to the US for a temporary time for exhibitions, and some private collectors or the artists decide to sell it in the US?"" Graham added that for modern and contemporary Chinese art, ""I know many of them were sold in the US to private collectors or museums after exhibitions."""

""We hope that the tariffs are not in place when the current crop is harvested, as we said, starting in a month. Longer-term tariffs would be very harmful to the profitability of Ohio soybean farmers,"" said Kirk Merritt, executive director of the Ohio Soybean Association (OSA), in a recent interview with Xinhua. The U.S. administration under President Donald Trump has levied tariffs on a host of products from around the world, and countries like China, India, Mexico and Canada have responded by slapping their own taxes on imports from the United States, especially on its breadbasket. LONG-TERM TARIFFS HARMFUL ""I think if the tariffs continue longer-term, it would be very harmful to Ohio soybean farmers and American soybean farmers,"" Merritt said at the OSA's headquarters in Worthington, 17 km south of Columbus, the state capital of Ohio. Independent research shows ""significant reductions in long-term profitability"" for soybean farmers if the tariffs are ""in place for several years,"" Merritt said. The estimated annual economic impact of the Ohio soybean industry on the Ohio economy exceeds 5.25 billion U.S. dollars, according to the OSA. Ohio was the seventh-largest soybean-producing state in 2017. The state's soybean farmers planted 5 million acres of soybeans last year and exported 1.8 billion dollars' worth of the crop. China bought more than 691 million dollars' worth of soybeans from Ohio in 2017. ""China has been for many years our largest export market, for Ohio, and for the United States,"" Merritt said. ""So our farmers understand the importance (of the international markets)."" The farmers are already feeling the squeeze. The soybean price decreased by approximately two dollars per bushel, which is about 20 percent, since China imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybeans in July. ""We have heard estimates of potential financial harm for crops that they are holding but not yet sold based on the drop in the price, of anywhere from 25,000 or 200,000 (dollars) for an individual farmer. It is a significant amount for farmers,"" said Merritt. The numbers are devastating for farmers who operate with high overhead and slim profit margins in the best of times. The break even on soybeans right now is approximately 9.50 dollars per bushel though it would vary very widely from one farm to the other, according to an analysis by researchers at Ohio State University. ""Prices currently are below break even. Most farmers are selling at 8.20 or 8.50 dollars' range on those specific beans. They would not make much,"" Merritt said. ""If it is not resolved in the next year, two years, three years, (it) will have a very adverse effect on their bottom line, will make them less profitable,"" he added. MARKET HARD TO BUILD Fred Yoder is a fourth-generation farmer from Plain City, 24 km away from Worthington. Yoder and his family farm around 1,500 acres of corn and soybeans. He also owns and operates his own retail farm seed business. Farmers come to him for help because he served as president of the National Corn Growers Association and has become an advocate not only for Ohio's agriculture industry, but the United States' as well. The tariffs have already given farmers in Ohio and the Midwest a ""very tough time,"" said the farmer, who has been involved in the agri-business for over 40 years. ""I've lost 100,000 dollars just from what I haven't got sold (in the futures market),"" Yoder said. As the harvest season is approaching, the situation is becoming ""very worrisome"" because most farmers have to borrow funds to put the crop out by buying the inputs, e.g. the seeds, the fertilizers and the crop protection products, he said. The possible loss of the Chinese market will greatly hurt Ohio and the U.S. soybean industry as no one market can replace the world's largest middle-class market, said Yoder, who had recently returned from a two-week trade mission to China. Agricultural experts warn when the farmers' income goes down, the ripple effects will penetrate Ohio's and the U.S. economy -- car dealers, grocery owners and bankers are going to feel the pinch. ""Our production will continue to increase in the coming years. So we will need new markets. In short-term, we certainly can sell more to Europe. We can sell more to Mexico, the Philippines, Indonesia ... But in longer-term, it won't make up for the market in China,"" Merritt said. After all, he said, it took American farmers over 35 years to build a market in China and they do not want to pass it over easily to their competitors like Brazil and Canada. TRADE, NOT AID There is little wonder that Ohio's elected officials and lawmakers are also beginning to sound the alarm. Republican Senators Rob Portman of Ohio and Joni Ernst of Iowa have teamed up with Alabama Democrat Doug Jones to introduce legislation that would clip the wings of the president's unilateral tariff powers. ""These are policies that are harming the economic interest of Americans who are important, most particularly the farmers,"" Ohio Governor John Kasich said. ""For farmers, farmers don't want welfare, they want trade. They want to be able to sell their stuff,"" said Kasich, referring to the Trump administration's announcement of a 12-billion-dollar plan to compensate farmers hurt by the trade battles. Furthermore, the aid actually ""stifles the ability for farmers to be competitive amongst each other,"" said Matt Dolan, an Ohio state senator. ""Tariffs don't necessarily hit the government. They hit individuals and corporations,"" Dolan added. ""There's no way we're going to ever survive without trade. U.S. agriculture can not survive without international trade, and China was our biggest trade partner and it's going to be very difficult to replace the business we are doing with China,"" said Yoder. ""We hope that the current situation will be resolved in a mutually beneficial way as well, that in a longer-term we will be able to continue that win-win partnership (with China),"" Merritt said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

""The difficult time that the two countries are passing through would probably deter travelers from joining group tours,"" Lin said. The trade tensions may also affect U.S.' pursuit of growing its global travel market, Jonathan Grella, executive vice-president of the U.S. Travel Association, told Las Vegas Review Journal recently. Increasing visits by Chinese tourists could help reverse what the U.S. perceives as imbalance in bilateral trade, bolster competitiveness and create American jobs, he said. In July, the Chinese Consulate General in San Francisco issued a travel warning to Chinese tourists, asking them to be cautious about burglaries while visiting San Francisco, Las Vegas, Seattle and other popular tourist destinations across the U.S.. The warning came in the wake of some recent robberies. While U.S. tourism is on tenterhooks, Turkey has seen a surge in the number of Chinese travelers, following recent weakness in local currency, the Turkish lira. The resulting favorable foreign exchange rate has stimulated Chinese tourists' enthusiasm for shopping in Turkey. Ctrip, China's largest online travel agency, said in early August that the number of Chinese people who searched for Turkey-related information on its website soared nearly 500 percent over the previous two weeks. This summer, the number of reservations for Turkish hotel rooms by Chinese tourists surged nearly 200 percent year-on-year. Prices of Turkish travel packages are expected to drop about 20 percent to 30 percent after the National Day Holiday break, given that the prices of flight tickets and hotels have already dropped quite a bit in recent weeks. ""Turkey offers electronic visas, and it's very fast and convenient to apply for visas. Passengers can book the trips just a week in advance. Our packages in summer have sold out quickly, and most reservations are now for the coming National Day holiday break,"" said Xiao Yinyuan, director of outbound travel at Ctrip. ""For our group tours, we've adjusted the schedules and added about one to two days for travelers to go shopping, as some said they would prefer to do that after the sightseeing tours,"" Xiao said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

SMEs hurt by higher US import tariffs or previously hindered by imports are embracing change and new strategies to thrive amid tensions. Biobase Group, a manufacturer of laboratory equipment and diagnostic kits based in Shandong province, stands out as one of the firms converting threats into opportunities and challenges into strength-enhancers. Gan Yiwu, chairman of Biobase, typifies this new style of corporate thinking. In his office, two maps adorn a wall. The world map highlights some countries and regions participating in the Belt and Road Initiative. The China map shows over 20 places marked with a dot. Together, the maps represent Gan's ambitious vision for Biobase's future footprint. That's a far cry from the recent past, when Biobase struggled to get orders â even from Chinese firms â because the latter were all busy importing from the United States. The trade dispute, however, has proved to be a game-changer. ""We've built offices in 19 Chinese cities now,"" Gan said, pointing to the national map. ""China is the world's second-largest consumer of medical equipment but the local market was heavily reliant on imports. Now, it's different. Opportunities beckon. We'll invest more now in innovation and on building our own brands."" Like Biobase, Zhejiang Huada New Material Corp, a producer and exporter of steel products like hot-dip steel sheets coated in aluminum and zinc, sees the trade dispute as an opportunity to grow. Its business has not been affected much by the tensions because the US has never been one of its key export markets. The success of the BRI, meanwhile, is encouraging the company to leverage China's brand equity and expand globally like many Chinese companies, said Wang Liping, general manager of Huada's overseas business. Founded in 2003, Huada New Material started exports to the Middle East in 2011 to exploit demand there amid a fiercely competitive domestic market. Its strategy to tap channels like international exhibitions paid rich dividends. Ninety percent of its $200 million annual output is exported to about 50 BRI participants, particularly infrastructure-hungry Southeast Asian markets, where potential for future growth is immense, Wang said. Pakistan, Vietnam and Thailand have become the company's key export markets, suggesting Chinese businesses offering customized quality products at competitive prices would do well to look beyond the US for future growth opportunities. ""Chinese companies must stand up and fight for their own interests,"" said Li Guanghui, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation. They need to exploit their strengths to the hilt, improve their efficiency, research and development and innovation ability and sharpen their focus on the core parts and technologies required, while China should deepen reform and opening-up, he said. US President Donald Trump's administration levied a 25 percent tariff on $16 billion worth of Chinese products on Aug 23, after imposing tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports in July. China responded in kind. The US also has threatened to levy a 25 percent duty on a wider range of Chinese imports worth $200 billion. Haier Group, China's largest home appliances producer, said its business was insulated from the impact of the trade dispute because it had chosen to build its own brand, innovation ability and localize its overseas operations, including in the US, rather than be an original equipment manufacturer, a kind of contract supplier. It boasts 10 R&D centers, 108 factories, 24 industrial parks and 66 marketing centers around the world. Haier expects 40 percent of its 2018 revenue to come from overseas, on a 30 percent year-on-year rise in non-China revenue. The company has 7,000 patents and 589 intellectual property certificates. It also has bolstered its offerings through mergers and acquisitions. Its success is a lesson for Chinese firms affected by the tariff conflict, analysts said. Xue Rongjiu, deputy director of the China Society for WTO Studies, said Trump's ""America First"" strategy is marked by irrational tariff threats, unfair measures and vindictive sanctions. But the BRI will offset its impact on the world economy, he said. WTO is the World Trade Organization. Long Guoqiang, vice-president of the Development Research Center of the State Council, said, ""The tariff row will likely push China to build closer ties with other economies and contribute more to a freer, fairer and more inclusive multilateral trade system via the BRI."" var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Two experts share their views with China Daily's Pan Yixuan on the issue. Excerpts follow: US should evaluate bilateral trade benefits Di Dongsheng, associate dean of the School of International Studies, and International Monetary Institute, Renmin University of China Although there is no winner in a trade war, China and the United States will not concede to each other's demands as long as they can bear the loss caused by reciprocal high tariffs. Many believe US President Donald Trump will change his protectionist stance if the majority of US citizens start opposing his tariff policy on Chinese products, but that may not necessarily be the case. That's because developed countries such as the US have followed deflation policies for years that could, to some extent, weaken the impact of inflation caused by tariff hikes. No wonder Trump has even declared, wrongly though, that the US is winning the tariff war. In 2017, exports to the US comprised 19 percent of China's total exports. And since the total exports accounted for 18.54 percent of China's GDP last year, a full-blown trade war would have limited impact on China's economy, although neither the Chinese government nor businesses want a trade war. The industrial upgrading of China, too, can soften the impact of a trade war. In the past, thanks to China's super-national treatment and abundant cheap labor, foreign enterprises used to compete with each other to invest in China. These foreign enterprises accounted for a large proportion of China's export industry while creating more jobs and establishing industrial chains. But in recent years such enterprises have been moving out of China to Southeast and South Asia, because labor costs in China have increased and there is a dearth of workers in low-end manufacturing industries. Besides, China's export industry is undergoing a transformation and the country is now capable of making breakthroughs in some new fields in which developed countries have not taken the lead. Thus, it is expected that China will overcome the temporary difficulties and emerge stronger from the turbulence in global trade. So, it's high time that the US realized it will get nothing out of a trade war and, instead, strived to end the tariff war. But the US seems set to continue with its protectionist policies for some time, during which both the US and China will suffer economic losses. It is important that Washington rationally evaluates the pros and cons of bilateral trade, and starts sincere talks with China. Or else, by the time Trump's trade policy gradually becomes ineffective, the US economy would suffer irreparable losses, because if Washington continues to impose higher tariffs on Chinese goods, Beijing will fight back."

[Photo/Xinhua] Washington hearings told of risk to children, threat to supply chains Each of those who testified told a different story, but with a similar theme. They said it was simply impossible to shift manufacturing back to the United States; they had invested time and resources in developing a supply chain using Chinese capacity; and imposing tariffs would not advance the goals of US President Donald Trump's administration. The US business executives were testifying last week at hearings on the proposed 25 percent tariffs the US says it will impose on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. At the hearings held by the US Trade Representative's Office, which were due to conclude on Monday, those who testified presented a long list of cost-effective products sourced from China that would be off-limits to numerous US consumers if the duties took effect. One witness after another pleaded for the Trump administration not to raise tariffs on more Chinese goods, saying that the escalating trade war between the world's two largest economies would risk the safety of US children and destroy many domestic businesses while disrupting supply chains. ""We strongly oppose the proposed tariffs, which will disrupt business models and cause lasting economic harm to American sports companies and to millions of American consumers who look to play sports and be active every day,"" said Tom Cove, president and CEO of the Sports & Fitness Industry Association. Cove was one of at least 360 industrial company representatives and business executives who descended on Washington to attend the hearings from Aug 20 to Monday. The demand to testify was so high that the number of days scheduled for the hearings had to be doubled. By Thursday, the US had imposed two rounds of 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods and was threatening to levy the same tariffs on $200 billion worth of additional Chinese goods, ranging from car tires to baseball gloves. At the hearings at the US International Trade Commission, witnesses have five minutes to present their case before answering questions from a government panel that includes the US Trade Representative Office, the state, labor, homeland security and commerce departments and some other organizations. Cove said his association, which has more than 300 member companies, has taken steps to diversify sourcing. ""But it can take years to find alternative production options, train the workforce, develop necessary infrastructure and build, or retrofit, a manufacturing facility,"" he testified. ""China remains a vital and not easily replaceable link in our industry's supply chain."""

""We're going to call it the United States-Mexico trade agreement,"" Trump said at an event in the Oval Office with outgoing Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto joining by phone call. ""We'll get rid of the name NAFTA. It has a bad connotation because the United States was hurt very badly by NAFTA for many years,"" he said. Pena Nieto insisted during the phone call that Canada should also be included in a final deal. ""It is our wish, Mr. President, that now Canada will also be able to be incorporated in all this. And I assume that they are going to carry out negotiations on the sensitive bilateral issues between Canada and the United States,"" he said through a translator. Trump said he would speak with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a little while and hoped to resume negotiations with Canada soon. ""One way or another we'll have a deal with Canada. It'll either be a tariff on cars or it'll be a negotiated deal,"" he said. ""Frankly, a tariff on cars is a much easier way to go. But perhaps the other would be much better for Canada,"" said the president. The U.S. push to finish NAFTA talks came after the Trump administration recently launched the national security investigation into automotive imports, a protectionist move that could disrupt the global auto supply chains. A spokesman for Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Monday that Canada will ""continue to work toward a modernized NAFTA,"" but would only sign a new agreement that is good for the country. ""We will only sign a new NAFTA that is good for Canada and good for the middle class. Canada's signature is required,"" the spokesman said. U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer, at the same event in the Oval Office, said he expects to submit a notice to Congress on Friday and the new trade agreement is likely to be signed at the end of November. The agreement, which subjects to congressional approval, will last 16 years and will be reviewed every six years, according to a senior administration official. ""At the end of that review, we would expect that the agreement would be extended for another 16 years,"" the official told reporters in a briefing call on Monday. While calling Monday's announcement by the United States and Mexico ""an important step toward modernizing NAFTA,"" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch emphasized that ""a final agreement should include Canada."" ""I look forward to reviewing the details of today's announcement and continuing to work with USTR to resolve these issues so that a revamped NAFTA can pass Congress and become law,"" Hatch said in a statement. As the main panel in the Senate overseeing trade issues, the finance committee's approval will be key to any trade deal.

Apart from US representatives, the meeting was also participated by Chinese deputies from China-funded enterprises in the US, Chinese industry associations, and legal profession, who strongly opposed the tariff plan. Expounding on the impact of the additional tariffs could place on both China and the US, the representatives called on the US government to remove their industries or products from the tariff list, so as to maintain healthy and stable China-US economic and trade relations. âThe tariff burden will be ultimately taken by US importers and consumers,â said Andrew Shoyer, the lawyer representing Fomdas Holding Group, a private company in eastern China,âs Zhejiang province, engaged in argo-food production whose canned oranges were targeted by the new tariff plan of the US. âSpecifically, those American consumers who do not have access to or cannot afford to buy fresh oranges will be severely impacted by the tariffs, such as schools and elderly care centers,â he pointed out during the hearing. The lawyer said Chinese canned oranges wereare irreplaceable in the US market. In 2017, the US imported more than 160,000 tons of canned oranges from China, 95 percent of its total consumption. âIf the US government levies 25 percent tariffs on Chinese canned oranges, the importers will face a rising raised cost of $350 for each ton, or about $50 million in total,â he added. A total of 1,170 Chinese agricultural products were on the proposed list that containeds 6,031 tariff lines. Many products of the traditional industries were put on the list after being accused of the so-called âinfringement of intellectual property rightsâ, which placed a number of businesses from both countries in helplessness. âThe US governmentâs proposed tariff plan on $200 billion worth of Chinese products is unilateral. It violates rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and sabotages global trading order,â said Yu Lu, deputy director of China Chamber of Commerce of Foodstuffs and Native Produce, who was present at the hearing. She introduced that between 1998 and 2017, the total trade volume of farm produce between China and the US grew from $2.7 billion to $31.7 billion. In 2017, Chinaâs trade deficit with the US on agricultural products exceeded $16.4 billion. For the US, China wasis the largest export market for destination of agricultural products farm produce, and the largest market of bulk commodities including soybeans, she said, elaborating that 62 percent of the US soybean production went to China. Stable China-US relations on agricultural trade will benefit farmers and consumers of both countries, Yu said, adding that the agricultural products on the proposed list subject to the additional tariffs account for 80 percent of Chinaâs agricultural exports to the US. She warned that iIt wouldwill greatly impact the US agricultural products farm produce market, drive up the cost offor US consumers and hinder agribusinesses hurt agricultural product processing companies and employment, she warned. âThe tariff policy is forcing our company to reevaluate the risks of building a new factory in Louisiana,â said James Newport, general manager of Wanhua Chemical US Holding Inc. Wanhua is an industrial leader of methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) production based in China with over 13,000 global employees. The company has established R&D center and sales office in the US. Last year, Wanhua Chemical Group announced a plan to build a new factory in Louisiana with an investment of $1.2 billion, which is expected to create more than 1,200 jobs for local community. But after the US government announced the tariff plan on steel and aluminum imports, and threatened to include aniline and other related chemical products in the $200 billion tariff list, the proposed Louisiana plant wouldwill cost an extra investment of tens of millions of dollars for Wanhua Chemical Group, putting its expansion plan in front of huge economic risk. âImposing additional tariffs on Chinese goods will impact various US industries,. Ffrom large enterprises with tens of thousands of employees to small family businesses, they which all have a high dependence on Chinese products, and to find substitutes in other countries in the short term would be difficult,â said Zhu Haicheng, a Chinese lawyer who spoke at the hearing on Wednesday. He told Peopleâs Daily that the process of the US to cancel tariff lines lacked transparency, and suggested that relevant Chinese companies should confer with US importers on countermeasures. It wasâs necessary for them to be well prepared, both commercially and legally, he added. âCompared with the previous additional tariffs on $34 billion and $16 billion of Chinese goods, the expanded range of $200 billion will cause even greater damage to the interests of the US and the international communityâ, said Tan Jian, head of the Legal Service Department of China Chamber of International Commerce. This is the third time for Tan to attend the hearing for Section 301 investigation in Washington. He noted that the increase of tariffs will would harm US companies who had have been trying to optimize allocation of resources around the world, the US consumers who favor cost-effective Chinese products, and millions of low-income families in the US. âChina Council for the Promotion of International Trade will not agree with the US government on imposing additional tariffs on these productsâ, said Tan, adding that ""China and the US should resolve their disputes through negotiations."" var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

As Vice Minister of Commerce and Deputy China International Trade Representative Wang Shouwen accepted the U.S. invitation and led a delegation here for resumed talks, the ball is in Washington's court to make this dialogue not another exercise in futility. The two-day conversation merits applause and aspiration as the world's two largest economies came back to the table after over two months' escalation of confrontation. Its implication of a mutual desire to manage the current divergences and curb further spillovers into the global growth and financial stability is a matter of course. Yet it always takes two to tango. Any fruit that might come from this round of exchange requires bonafide interactions and stand-in-your-shoes thinking on both sides. This is by no means a one-way street for China. Although the U.S. delivery of invitation to China has shown its readiness for negotiating deals, the soul of ""the art of the deal"" lies more on ungrudging concession than on forced bargain. The maximum pressure approach featuring my-way-or-no-way logic and zero-sum mentality has proved infructuous to China, and risks a renewed no-win prospect. Previous trade talks between the two countries have offered abundant lessons for both to circumvent misunderstanding and misjudgment while engaging in this hard-won opportunity for negotiations. Among them is the requisite of a more sensible approach on the U.S. side that highlights mutual understanding rather than one-sided pressuring. Any mutually acceptable results of this round of talks must depend on two-way efforts, with two parties meeting each other halfway. Also, as the saying goes, Rome was not built overnight. The different phases of development in China and the United States make the settlement of issues such as market access unattainable at one stroke; yet with vast areas of overlapping interests, the two sides should be more patient and seek common ground while putting aside differences. The success of the discussions also requires a mutually recognized priority list of problems. However, Washington remains nubilous in this regard, given that the U.S. authorities such as the White House, the Treasury Department and the Office of the United States Trade Representative have been at cross purposes regarding their priorities with China. As U.S. President Donald Trump said in his book on making deals, ""the point is that you can't be too greedy."" The two sides would hence be advisable to define their top concerns in this round of talks and outline a roadmap, in a bid to find a way out of the current impasse and towards the final settlement of the issues. Moreover, since the significance of trustworthiness is second to none in negotiations, the U.S. side should be ready to re-engage in its commitments than renege on them, if it really means it. Any fruits of the bilateral dialogue will once against come to naught if Washington goes back on its word as it did before. Credibility for a state plays the role of character for a human being, and it's in a country's interests to keep faith with others. While mulling its trade strategy on China, Washington cannot overlook the cries of U.S. industries affected or to be affected by its current confrontation with China. Warns of U.S. tactics' backfire effects, such as the disruption of global supply chain, the disability of U.S. private sector, job losses, and damage to the interests of consumers, have dominated the ongoing six-day public hearings process, which solicits business and industrial comments on the proposed tariffs on Chinese imports worth 200 billion U.S. dollars. In fact, unilateral tariff tactic has never made its way in the U.S. history. Spillovers of a trade faceoff with the world's second largest economy will from each and every aspect be more biting than Washington could ever imagine. Washington's huff-and-puff bluster and now-or-never ultimatum will only cut short the odd of a productive dialogue. The United States should rationally review the China-U.S. trade relations, look for a win-win solution to the dispute through equal negotiation with China, and jointly safeguard the open and rules-based multilateral trade system. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

They are voicing their concerns at public hearings in the capital. The Office of US Trade Representative first proposed a 10% tariff on about 200 billion of Chinese imports in July and later raised that rate to 25%. This week and next Monday a public hearing on the proposal is being held in Washington DC. Most representatives at the hearing voiced strong opposition against the proposal, saying a tariff hike will result in a heavy burden on American companies, and ultimately rising prices for American consumers. Bob Margevicius is executive vice President for Bicycle Product Suppliers Association and Specialized Bicycle Components in America. ""The biggest concern is that it impacts virtually all bicycles, in particular it impacts children's bicycles. The majority we import here in the US are children's bikes. Children's bikes are entry points for kids to get involved in cycling. They become immersed and they become part of it. It actually engages them for future usage of bikes and for the future being part of our industry. So we really need them."" Margevicius began his testimony at the hearing by asking the panelists if they still remember how exciting it was for them to get their first bike. When I asked him if adjusting the supply chain will be able to help them evade tariffs, he told me it won't be easy. ""Individual components are produced locally in China, whether through Tianjin, or Kunshan, or in the Shenzhen area. The products themselves need to meet safety requirements. So to transition from one country to another takes a lot of time to build the manufacturing cluster. It's a difficult and complex project for us."" Americans buy about 18 million bikes every year and most of these bikes come from China. Statistics show that if the US government were to impose tariffs on bikes and related products coming from China, the accumulative tariffs rate for American consumers will be as high as 36%. The even bigger concern is that this will cause bike retail stores to close, the bike industry to shrink, and people employed in the industry to lose their jobs. An argument frequently raised by trade entity representatives at the hearing is that over the years China has developed a high level of craftsmanship and labor quality, which makes it very hard for them to find substitute makers in other countries in a short period of time. Ross Bishop, once an engineer of major US defense tech company Lockheed Martin and a pilot, is now president of a company that produces specialized luggage for pilots. He said if you pick the right factory in China, the workers can be artists. ""We've worked with factories in Vietnam before. The products weren't as good and they ended up getting more and more expensive. So if you can work with the best force and with the best price, and it happens to be China, and that's what you are going to do."" Bishop also told me that his company was planning to expand its business, but the government's tariffs proposal is forcing them to slow down. Besides all the frustration and anger from manufacturers in the country, the bigger worry is obviously placed on American households, who many argue will eventually pay for the protectionist trade approach by the government. Lawyer Francis Sailer said ""this is not a tariff that's going to in any way hurt China. It's gonna hurt Tom, Jones, and Bob, Smith, and the guys who have the startup companies that rely on the expertise that's been developed in China. So it's crazy."" The Office of the US Trade Representative said earlier that due to an unforeseen number of entities seeking to present their cases, the length of the hearing had been doubled. It's estimated that over 350 representatives from US companies and trade associations will attend the hearing. Written statements will be received till September 6th and after that the panel at the hearing will deliver a policy recommendation to the US Trade Representative. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

(Xinhua/Wang Ping) DETROIT, the United States, Aug. 21 (Xinhua) -- The global nature of the automotive industry today means any change to its supply chain could be detrimental to all. As the U.S. government rolled out additional tariffs on imported goods from some of its important trading partners, auto companies in Michigan are losing sleep over trade fears. Industry insiders and experts said the Trump administration's tariff plan, which shows U.S. misconception about world trade, will certainly lead to a lose-lose situation. AUTO COST SPIKE In its second-quarter earnings report released in July, General Motors cut its profit outlook for the year, citing significant increases in commodity costs. The automaker now expects to achieve earnings per diluted share of 6 U.S. dollars for the whole year, down from its previous forecast of 6.3 to 6.6 dollars. Its rival Ford Motor Co. has seen commodity costs rising 300 million dollars from last year, attributing about half of that to the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum. The tariffs are expected to eat up about 600 million dollars in profit in 2018, the automaker's Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told media earlier. Fiat Chrysler, along with its German, Japanese and South Korean competitors, have all voiced their concerns about potential impact additional tariffs on steel, aluminum, and other intermediate goods could bring to the industry. Auto parts suppliers have already taken the fall. Henniges Automotive, which produces automotive sealing, said they've already seen cost rising. Lucerne International, which fabricates auto parts in its Asian plants and ship them back to the United States, is worried that the company's profit margin is too thin to offset the rise of costs. Like Lucerne International, many auto parts suppliers that are locked in long-term contracts with its clients will not be able to pass on higher costs. There are few ways for them to lower costs and break even. The companies will then be caught in a dilemma: whether to cling on to major clients running at a loss, or to stop loss by terminating partnership. Either way the companies will suffer heavily. Other suppliers may pass the higher costs to automakers, which will lead to higher prices of certain car models. ""In the end, everybody loses,"" said Shuo Wang, president of Michigan-based automotive supplier STEC USA, a subsidiary of Shanghai-based automaker SAIC Motor Corporation Limited. GLOBALIZATION BEHIND JOB LOSSES? One of the Trump administration's intentions to add tariffs on autos, auto parts, steel and aluminum is to bring manufacturing back to the United States and revive jobs. However, experts said the idea shows U.S. misconception about world trade. Farok J. Contractor, a professor in Rutgers Business School's management and global business department, said that while jobs will be preserved for a while against international competition in industries such as steel, winning back those already gone is difficult because global value chains take time to be reshaped. He pointed out the fact that U.S. workers are losing many jobs because of automation rather than outsourcing. Statistics show that for every U.S. job lost through international outsourcing, three jobs are lost because of automation. ""It makes sense that American firms would prefer automation to outsourcing given the relative strength and size of the workforce in the United States,"" said an article from the Harvard Political Review published in July. Globalization and international trade are not to be blamed entirely for the loss of jobs in the United States, said the professor, whose conclusion is most evident in the automotive industry. As automakers expand their global footprint to reach the widest consumers possible, they are inclined to choose suppliers that could provide them auto parts globally in order to manage cost and quality. The inherent requirement for auto parts suppliers is to go global with automakers. STEC opened a plant in Madison Heights, Michigan in 2014 to stay as close to its customers as possible, marking another step in its global expansion. The Chinese company has a global workforce of more than 6,000 serving more than 50 customers in every major region of the world. STEC USA has since employed 15 U.S. locals and is aiming to hire more than 10 times that figure. FOREIGN BENEFITS At Henniges' headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan, Chinese national flag stood high in front of the building, alongside those of the United States, Mexico, Germany, and many more, showcasing the company's global presence. In 2015, the company was bought by the Aviation Industry Corporation of China. Larry Williams, the president of Henniges, said the change of ownership allowed the auto parts supplier to adopt a long-term development goal and grow at a much quicker pace. The capital investment provided the company with an opportunity to expand abroad and add jobs at its U.S. facilities. Williams said that Henniges added three new plants in the past two and a half years under the current ownership, compared with two new plants added in more than a decade when the company was under the previous ownership. Many similar stories could be told by auto companies in Michigan and beyond, where the stronger-than-ever foreign presence has brought benefits to U.S. companies, workers and consumers alike. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) is holding public hearings on Aug. 20-24, and on Aug. 27, regarding proposed tariffs on approximately 200 billion dollars worth of Chinese products. According to the USTR, the proposed tariffs are a supplemental action in response to China's unfair trade practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation, based on findings in its investigation of China under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. Williams said the accusation runs contrary to his observation. ""There's a lot of sharing (of technology between Chinese companies and European or U.S. companies) that goes on, which creates some competition but ultimately improves the environment,"" said Williams. Representatives of the U.S. auto industry are expected to voice concerns or opposition to the proposed tariff list."

Many said that hefty duties harm US consumers, workers and businesses as well as the economy. US President Donald Trump has directed the US trade representative to consider increasing the additional duty from 10 percent to 25 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, targeting thousands of consumer products ranging from chemicals to cosmetics. The tariffs would be the same as those the US has already imposed on $34 billion in Chinese goods, and on another $16 billion to be activated on Thursday. A Chinese delegation led by Vice-Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen will visit the US this week to talk with his counterpart on bilateral economic and trade issues. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Tuesday that China hopes the talks with the US ""reach a good result"" on the basis of equality and good credibility. Many executives testified on Monday that production of the targeted Chinese imports could not feasibly shift to the US. Ross Bishop, president of BrightLine Bags, whose products are manufactured in China, said: ""We've made three specific and concerted attempts to get our bags made in the US and have learned from each instance that our costs would triple compared to what we pay now, and the detailed quality isn't as good."" Already paying 17.6 percent duties, an additional 25 percent would bring the total to ""an absurd level of 42.6 percent"", which has the ""undeniable potential"" to cripple his company, he said. The actions taken by the Trump administration do not represent the will and interests of the US people or companies, but serve their own political purpose, said Shen Jianguang, chief economist at JD Finance. ""The actions keep neglecting the fact that many products manufactured in China such as semiconductors, smartphones and construction machinery are invested in and operated by US companies."" The Beijing-based China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products urged the US government to remove products such as refrigerators from the proposed tariff list, as they easily affect daily lives in the US. Xue Rongjiu, deputy director of the China Society for WTO Studies, said China's foreign trade has great resilience, and the country has already begun to further stimulate domestic consumption and diversify its exports to minimize impact from the China-US trade dispute.

The IMF, in its latest world economic outlook report, said the recent US tariffs and its planning policies will more than likely escalate trade tensions and have an adverse effect on confidence, asset prices, and investment. Escalating and sustained trade conflicts following US tariff actions threaten to derail economic recovery and depress medium-term growth prospects, the report warned. IMF officials will closely monitor the situation, said Ding Ding, a senior economist with IMFâs Asia and Pacific Department. ""We hope relevant countries avoid using unconventional measures and should conduct trade cooperation under an open, rule-based multilateral system to defuse trade tensions,â the economist added. The development of international trade and multilateralism over the past decades has benefited the majority of countries, Ding pointed out, lauding that China, as a beneficiary as well, has gone to great length to maintain multilateral order, and especially so since first joining the World Trade Organization in 2001. The IMF concluded in its latest outlook that the widespread political malaise driving many current policy risks, including on the trade front, has roots in several countriesâ experiences of non-inclusive growth and structural transformation. Given these challenges, the multilateral body called on countries to resist inward-looking thinking, uphold multilateral trading system, seek more balanced global economy, and devote to financial stability. As an expert who has followed and studied the Chinese economy for years, Ding highly affirmed Chinaâs efforts to shift its economic focus from high-speed growth to high-quality growth. This means that China no longer blindly pursues speed and quantity, but seeks to achieve more sustainable, inclusive and green growth, he explained. Although China's economic growth has slowed down in recent years, the momentum of development is still strong and there is still a lot of room for growth, according to the economist, who added that China's contribution to global economic growth will remain at a relatively high level, about 30 percent. ""The IMF appreciates the progress China has made in economic reform over the past few years,"" Ding said, citing examples of how China has effectively reduced financial risks, reduced reliance on credit for economic growth, and made positive progress in addressing overcapacity and curbing pollution. In terms of financial regulations, Ding illustrated the committee the State Council established last year to oversee financial stability and development is very effective measure. Ding said that ""both China and the world have benefited"" from Chinaâs reform and opening-up in the past four decades. ""China's own success is unprecedented and its development from one of the world's poorest countries to the second largest economy in the world, along with its success in lifting more than 700 million people out of poverty, is a remarkable achievement,â he elaborated, adding that China has also become a vital growth engine driving world economic recovery and growth, especially in the wake of the international financial crisis. He further pointed out that if Chinaâs goal of eliminating absolute poverty by 2020 can be accomplished as scheduled, it will be another amazing achievement in the history of human development. âIn the future, China needs to accelerate the pace and improve the level of its opening-up, which is not only in China's interests, but will provide more opportunities for countries around the world,â Ding said, adding that China has deeply integrated itself into the current international system thanks to its reform and opening-up policy. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

(By Wu Lejun from Peopleâs Daily) Only cooperation can bring China and the US a win-win prospect, said governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky, a southeastern state of the US, stressing that a closer partnership between individual residents, businesses and sister cities is of great significance for the future of the worldâs two largest economies. Describing challenges facing bilateral cooperation as an inescapable process, Bevin said what can be done now is to ensure a more intimate national and public bond no matter what is happening at the federal government level by cementing the exchanges at lower level. âWe must bear big picture in mind when looking into future, instead of stubbornly confining the horizon to the figures of trade surplus or deficits,â Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankaisaid at the welcome banquet held byBevin on Monday. Cui stressed the importance of macro perspective when seriously and effectively handling the emerging problems. His remarks were echoed by the business representatives attending the banquet, who also expressed their strong aspiration for an intensified China-US economic and trade cooperation, and a healthy bilateral relationship. Kentucky sits in the front row among the US states in terms of exports to China. Data released by Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development showed that the stateâs exports to China, its fourth largest exportation destination, increased by 60% in 2017, and the vast majority was constituted by aerospace products. By the end of this February, seven Chinese companies had bet as much as $10 billion dollars in the state by making investment or establishing plants, creating over 8,000 jobs directly for local residents. After the US started to impose additional tariffs of 25 percent on Chinese goods worth $34 billion on July 6, a batch of centrifuges shipped to Kentucky-based Birtley Industrial Equipment Corporation, a provider of coal washing equipment, have fallen into one of the first victims, said general manager Zhao Chaoxun of Birtley, the first China-invested company in Kentucky. âThe equipment were manufactured by our parent company in China, and our American clients also feel frustrating as they have to pay for the costs resulted from additional tariffs,â said Zhao, in a hope that the US administration could properlyresolve the trade tensions as soon as possible. Itâs headache that the additional tariff has raised the operation costs of local businesses, he told the Peopleâs Daily frankly. The manger recalled that when Birtley plant was set up in 2013, US produced roughly 1 billion tons of coal each year, and Kentucky, who contributed a tenth to the national production, had a high demand for heavy duty coal equipment. But trends in the coal industry began to change soon after the investment was made, and US coal production dropped more than 25 percent in the last few years, he said, adding that his company has already devoted energy to environment-friendly projects to adapt to the new situation. The US bourbon whiskey industry is in trouble as well after it was selected by many countries and regions as a target for retaliation. âThe tariff is a great blow to local producers like us,â Eric Gregory, President of the Kentucky Distillers' Association complained. He told the Peopleâs Daily that bourbon whiskey, which was recognized by the US Congress as a ""distinctive product of the US"" by concurrent resolution, has created 17,500 jobs and an annual value of about $8.5 billion for Kentucky. Admitting that exploration of overseas market is not an easy job, Gregory said local producers lay importance on the emerging Chinese market with huge potential. âWe have expressed our concerns to the state and federal governments,â he said, stressing that free trade is the key precondition to sell bourbon whiskey around the world, and the ongoing trade dispute is now top challenge for local wineries. âBourbon whiskey producers feel annoyed with the tensions. We have been worrying about a revenge resulted from the US tariff policy, but the fear finally turned into reality,â Gregory said, warning that it will severely hit the overseas market of Kentucky-made bourbon whiskey, and lead to dire consequences including reduced employment and factory shutdown. What Zhao and Gregory said were agreed by more business representatives in the state. Describing economic growth as a result of establishing partnership, trusting each other and choosing the right timing, Robert L. Quick, President and CEO of Commerce Lexington, one of Kentuckyâs largest chambers of commerce, said that they expect a long-term and stable economic and trade relationship with China. This July, he and chiefs of 58 local firms voiced their concerns over the tariff policy to Washington, in a hope that the White House can find out a proper solution. Quick believes that though the trade disputes have not come to an end, bilateral economic and trade ties will brace for better future as long as both sides bolster cooperation and consultation. This is the consensus shared by many of our members, said the CEO, whose chamber represents about 1,750 members. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Turkey, in an official decree, announced to raise tariffs on imports of US passenger cars to 120 percent, alcoholic drinks to 140 percent and leaf tobacco to 60 percent, Reuters reported on Wednesday, adding that tariffs were also increased on goods such as cosmetics, rice and coal. Such a tariff policy was made shortly after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced to boycott US electronic goods. On August 10, US President Donald Trump said he was doubling import tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum, and tweeted that ""our relations with Turkey are not good at this time,"" reported The Guardian. The Turkish currency lira plummeted by 17 percent against the US dollar on the same day. The US-Turkey relations have been deteriorating since Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric living in the US in exile, was blamed by Ankara for a failed coup in 2016. The situation got worse since this August. In October 2016, an American pastor Andrew Craig Brunson was imprisoned in Turkey on the charge of masterminding a failed military coup against Turkish President Erdogan. After repeatedly urging Turkey to release Brunson, Washington threatened on July 26 that it will launch sanctions against Turkey if Ankara fails to return the pastor, but was refuted by Ankara, who replied that sanctions and threats would not work. The US-Turkey alliance finally encountered a huge challenge on August 10 when the US announced to sanction Turkey after a string of tit-for-tat war of words. Trump's sanctions on Turkey are expression of dissatisfaction on the Erdogan administration's getting far away from the western political system and values, as well as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) since 2016, said Sun Degang, deputy director of Middle East Studies Institute at Shanghai International Studies University, adding that the decision also serves the US midterm elections. Since the end of World War II, the US has offered substantial military and economic aids to Turkey from 1947 with the enactment of the Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan. A Turkey-US alliance was officially established after the former joined NATO in February 1952. But after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the bilateral relationship between the US and Turkey entered a transformation period under the impacts of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Erdogan administration proposed the strategic depth doctrine as its foreign policy after the Justice and Development Party (AKP) came into power, and set goals for 2023 when Turkey will mark its 100th anniversary, making the Turkish diplomacy more independent and diverse. ""The Erdogan administration doesn't want to be a pawn in the game controlled by the US and the western world, or a so-called ""second class"" NATO country. What it seeks is to be a bridge linking the East and the West, find a development path that suits its country and become a respectable nation, Sun told the People's Daily, explaining that it is the root cause for the US-Turkey conflicts. The arrest of Brunson, according to him, is a fuse leading to deterioration of US-Turkey ties. ""It indicated that the US, who is on one hand manipulating Turkey to make profits in the Middle East, and on the other hand promoting a color revolution and regime change in its allies by Gulen movement and religion, is intolerable for Erdogan,"" Sun explained. The US and Turkey are confronting each other over the strategic interests in the Middle East. Turkey is seeking close cooperation with the US rivals â Russia and Iran â on the Syrian issue, and objects the US for the latter's prevention of economic and trade relations between Turkey and Iran through unilateral sanctions. Turkey supports Palestine and opposes Israel's expansion policies on the IsraeliâPalestinian conflict. In addition, Turkey has captured the north of Syria and fought against the Kurdish ally of the US in Syria â the People's Protection Units. Impacted by the announced sanctions of the US, the exchange rate of Turkish lira against the US dollar plunged on August 10, making the largest single-day decline since the 2001 Turkish economic crisis. The Turkish currency has fallen more than 40 percent this year. The depreciation of lira, capital outflow, increasingly severe livelihood challenges, as well as sharpening social contradictions have placed huge challenges on the long-term governance of Erdogan. Erdogan, in an article published on US media last Saturday, warned that the US-Turkey partnership could be in jeopardy if their relations remain tense, which will require his country to start looking for new friends and allies. But he also described Turkey as ""strategic partner in NATO"" of the US. Turkey needs to improve relations with the West, especially the US, if it hopes to completely walk out of the economic shadow, analysts said, adding that the Trump administration will avoid pushing Turkey into Russia's arms. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The reason of the choice is really that simple as analysed by the company Oxford Economics. In the comprehensive study ""Understanding the U.S.-China Trade Relationship"", it found: ""Chinese manufacturingâ¦ lowered prices in the United States for consumer goods, dampening inflation and putting more money in American wallets."" It said, ""At an aggregate level, U.S. consumer prices are 1 percent -- 1.5 percent lower because of cheaper Chinese imports."" ""The typical U.S. household earned about 56,500 dollars, trade with China therefore saved these families up to 850 dollars that year,"" it noted. The reverse is therefore also true -- blocking off Chinese imports through tariffs will raise prices for the average U.S. household by 850 dollars, it said. How tariffs are already raising U.S. prices The study said, as the tariffs against China, which affected 34 billion dollars worth of imports, only came into force on July 6, it is, of course, too early to see their full impact. But the effect of other tariffs, and the price rises they caused, makes crystal clear what will happen to U.S. prices if tariffs against China are introduced. A tariff on washing machines was followed by a 20 percent increase in the price of washing machines and dryers in the U.S. The second major new tariff was on steel and aluminium. Steel prices were already rising in the U.S. before these tariffs were introduced but the tariffs inevitably significantly worsened this. By July 2018 U.S. prices on hot rolled band steel, used in numerous U.S. products, were 52 percent above their level in October 2017. The study went on, The Wall Street Journal noted: ""Polaris is raising prices on itsâ¦ recreational vehicles to cover $15 million of the $40 million in tariff-related costs the Minnesota-based manufacturer expects to pay for foreign-made steel, aluminium and components from China this year. Polaris is also facing retaliatory tariffs from other countries on products it exports from the U.S., including theâ¦ motorcycles it ships to Europe. Chief Executive Scott Wine said Polaris would accelerate plans to move production of motorcycles that it sells in Europe to Poland from Iowa to avoid rising European Union tariffs on U.S. motorcycles."" This follows Harley-Davidson's decision to relocate part of its production out of the U.S. in order to avoid Europe's retaliation against U.S. tariffs, it added. It continued that aluminium prices have increased by 11 percent. As a result, Coca Cola, the U.S.'s most iconic soft drink, announced it was taking the unusual step of raising prices midyear in North America because of rising costs, including prices for aluminium, it said. Thousands of other manufacturers will be similarly affected. Caterpillar, the biggest U.S. construction equipment manufacturer, announced that it expected losses of 100-200 million dollars from tariffs -- putting upward pressure on its future prices. The result of tariffs was therefore accurately summarized by the Wall Street Journal as ""Soda, Motorcycle Prices Rise as Tariffs Hit Home for Consumers"". But tariffs on washing machines, which affected 10.3 billion dollars of imports, and on steel and aluminium, affecting 44.9 billion dollars of imports, cover a much smaller range of goods than tariffs affecting 250 billion dollars of imports which have been threatened by the Trump administration against China. The price rise consequences of U.S. tariffs against China for U.S. buyers will therefore be more severe, it noted. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

""From this moment on, it's going to be America First,"" the president claimed. ""Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families."" US analysts believe that the slogan which advocates ""Americanism"" rather than ""globalism"" suggests that the US has abandoned the diplomatic policies it persisted over the past 7 decades as well as its contract with the world. After more than a year of observing American diplomatic practice, people have seen the US strides under the slogan ""America First"", but the complaints of those Americans who have not felt the benefits of ""America First"" are piling up. The US initiated the trade friction, and what comes after the quick thrill can only be recession, as the country is actually firing at itself when pointing the gun to the world. Even though the US farms are about to embrace a big harvest this year, the Illinois farmer Grede still gets little of the pleasure - the trade war is resulting in a $100 loss per acre for his farm. The US government announced a $12 billion subsidy for farmers wounded by trade war, but the latter could get at most $14 compensation for each acre. US consumer prices rose 2.9 percent over the past year, a rate last exceeded in late 2011, the US Department of Labor admitted last Friday. Core pricesâthose outside of volatile food and energy-related expensesâclimbed 2.4 percent, the biggest annual gain since September 2008. The US workers' weekly wage saw a slight increase of 0.1 percent over the past 12 months, but such performance was achieved by working overtime since they earned less per hour after the deduction of inflation factor. ""Workers are not benefiting from the Trump economy."" That was what the Democratic National Committee concluded in a statement issued last Friday. The White House may not be interested in the small bills of ordinary US citizens. But the question is, how much patience do the US policy makers have for making scientific calculations, even on the bills at a national level? To be mad at the figures will not help reduce trade deficits. Washington has to seriously evaluate the supply-demand structures of both domestic and international markets. The US trade deficits saw the largest increase in a year and a half this June when Washington declared to start the trade war, largely because the prospect of tightened tariffs has forced the US enterprises to import more. A UK-based macro-economic research institute warned that the trade deficits of the US may go up by $3 billion each month instead of being reduced given the trade war on escalation. Such conclusion has its reasons. After all, the US market has its rigid demands. Former Chief Economist of World Bank Kaushik Basu has stressed that the complaint of a specific country on trade deficits is as meaningless as one made by a family on its own spending at groceries, barber shops and dental hospitals. An incredible thing is that it seems the US trade policy makers have all turned deaf, as the voices from industries, international community and professional research institutes never go into their ears. US entrepreneurs have felt the pain of the ""America First"" policy at a moment when they are about to lose the giant market of China. ""To play the tariff card is not cost-efficient for US economy, since the US only takes a very tiny part on global market, and this is a blow for us,"" said a US entrepreneur. Professor Dani Rodrik of International Political Economy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University believes the US-initiated trade war reflects that ""the fever runs highest in the US"". He reminded that China's policies have not only generated significant domestic economic growth and poverty reduction, but also created a huge market for western exports and investment. The US is being ignorant by attacking China because of the trade imbalance, and such practice is also irrational and hypocritical, said David Dollar, who was the US Treasury's economic and financial emissary to China from 2009 to 2013. It remains unknown when the trade policy makers of the US will return to rationality, but the side-effect of the ""America First"" policy has emerged. It will just be a matter of time before the slogan decays. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Arkansas has always been committed to fostering a good partnership with Chinese enterprises, Mike Preston, executive director of the Arkansas Economic Development Commission, told the Peopleâs Daily. China is now the 5th largest export destination and the biggest source of imports for Arkansas, who has witnessed rapid development of economic and trade relations with China in recent years. âWe do our best to attract the Chinese investors and encourage our companies to invest in China. Walmart, the largest firm in Arkansas as well as the US, now owns more than 300 stores in China. Tyson Foods, also based in Arkansas, enjoys business prosperity in China as well,â he said, adding that the commission is also pushing for more agricultural exports to China. The US official is very concerned about the US-started trade frictions, saying the US tariff policy could place negative impact on other countries and ultimately lead to a vicious tariff barrier that hurts global trading system. âArkansas agricultural exports will inevitably be severely impacted. With the rise in export prices of agriculture products, the farmersâ income will be reduced,â Preston said, explaining that it is why they are paying close attention to the tariff policy of the federal government. The tariff policy will bring negative influence to multiple sectors, including trade relations, employment, consumption, commodity prices and peopleâs livelihood, Preston noted, adding the US-China trade frictions will hurt the interests of other countries as well. It has been proved by history that a trade war does no good to the economy of any country or the world, he said. âThere is no reason to start a trade war when interdependence matters so much,â he pointed out. In recent years, more and more Chinese enterprises are investing in Arkansas, such as Shandong Sun Paper, as well as Suzhou-based textiles and clothing companies Ruyi and Tianyuan Garments Company. Over the past two years, these companies have invested a total of more than $1.4 billion in the state and created more than 1,500 jobs for local community, which is significant for Arkansas, a state with a population of about 3 million. In a belief that the priority of the state government is to introduce investment and create employment, Preston said Chinese enterprises have promoted Arkansasâ employment and economic growth, which is a win-win choice. The two countries should cherish the valuable close bilateral cooperation they developed over the past 40-some years, since they barely had economic or trade exchanges when the late US President Richard Nixon visited China in 1972, Preston remarked. âI hope that China and the US could properly solve the trade frictions, and that would be the best for both economies,â he said. As an important pivot connecting East Coast and the Midwest of the US, Pittsburgh in the state of Pennsylvania recently launched a direct flight route to Shanghai. To cater for Chinese passengers, the US airport not only specifically adds Chinese signs and prepares hot water, but also offers travel guidebooks and souvenirs to every Chinese tourist. In addition, Chinese-speaking volunteers are available at the airport, and Chinese tourists can take the tour buses immediately after landing at the parking apron. The Pittsburgh International Airport is the first US airport to exploit the fast-growing Chinese tourism market by opening regular chartered direct flights, according to CEO of the airport Christina Cassotis. This year, Pittsburgh has even launched a campaign to make itself better prepared for Chinese tourists. Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald told Peopleâs Daily that Pittsburgh is the first medium-sized US city to launch a direct flight route to China. He believes that the cooperation will benefit not only the airport and the tourism sector, but also all business segments of the city. Speaking of the China-US trade frictions, the county executive admitted that they have no control over the White House decisions, but he believes economic and trade cooperation will benefit both sides. Michael Matesic, CEO of a foreign cooperation accelerator in Pittsburgh also expressed his hope that China and the US can properly handle the current difficulty. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

For instance, two transformers worth over 12 million yuan were recently sent back to China for maintenance from an Ethiopian industrial park, and it only took 70 minutes for the two machines to go through all the procedures from acceptance to inspection at Shanghai Wusong Customs. âThe applicant waited at only one counter, and the examination and inspection of the cargos were completed in only one round,â said the declarer of the two transformers, adding that total time spent was reduced by over half from before. Suning, one of China's largest retailers, has expanded its purchase from Belt and Road countries and regions, including the ASEAN and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), said Xu Hailan, executive vice president of the second East China division of Suning. Xu explained that food, health care products, fresh produce, as well as baby and maternal products from these regions are very popular in China. The value of the first direct purchase of durians from Thailand reached 940,000 yuan, he said, adding that direct purchases of fresh produce accounted for the majority of imports from Belt and Road countries and regions. Suning will help build the supply chain for these places of origin through its experiences on smart retail such as big data, block chain, and automatic logistics, he noted. The first China International Import Expo (CIIE), which is scheduled to kick off this November in Shanghai, has attracted huge attention and the exhibition booths have almost been fully booked, according to its organizer the China International Import Expo Bureau. A great number of visitors have registered for the expo as well. By Aug. 7, more than 160,000 purchasing agents from over 80,000 domestic and foreign enterprises have registered for the event, far more than the planned figure of 150,000. âThe CIIE creates conditions for China to further expand imports, and it also diversifies resource allocation and improves efficiency,â said Xu, pointing out at the same time that China has made progress regarding diversification of the domestic consumption market and trade facilitation, accumulating new momentum for foreign trade. With the advancement of the Belt and Road construction, the National (Regional) Pavilions of Belt and Road countries at the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone are embracing new development opportunities. Making efforts on administrative reform, Shanghai Customs is building a filing mechanism to support the National (Regional) Pavilions of Belt and Road countries, so as to facilitate the efficient flow of market factors. CEE commodities, as well as cultural and travel products are on routine exhibition at the 16 CEE countries' pavilions. There are more than 300 varieties of rose products at the National Pavilion of Bulgaria, and 10 Georgian wineries exhibiting their products at the show room of the Wine Center of Georgia. Starting from the principle of achieving shared growth through discussion and collaboration, Shanghai Customs adjusted tariffs on the competitive products from Belt and Road countries and regions to expand import of these commodities. Shanghai Customs found that the tariff cut on nuts from Pakistan and other countries has not only met the demand of domestic consumers, but also promoted China's trade relations with Belt and Road countries and regions. A combination of measures has been adopted to improve trade facilitation and release policy dividends, said an official from Shanghai Customs, elaborating that 200,000 batches of imported goods from Belt and Road countries under preferential trade agreements were handled by Shanghai Customs in 2017, up 15.1 percent from a year ago. These batches of goods were worth 98.16 billion yuan, and the tax exemption was 11.97 billion yuan, respectively growing by 30.6 percent and 29.1 percent year on year. The value and tax exemption accounted for 54.8 percent and 66.4 percent of the total value of goods and tariff preference under the preferential trade measures of Shanghai Customs in 2017, and 25 percent and 29.5 percent of those under the national preferential trade measures related to Belt and Road countries, according to the official. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The major source of imported soybean products can be easily substituted, with sufficient crop supplies around the world that can be processed into oil and meal, said Yu Xubo, president of China's largest grain enterprise China National Cereal, Oils and Foodstuff Corporation (COFCO). Yu said the soybean shortage caused by a decrease of soybean imports from the U.S. can be made up by importing soybean products from other countries and regions. Industry insiders discussed that in the long run, regions such as South America and the Black Sea have great potential to play bigger roles in the global soybean supply chain. Evidence for this comes from the Sinograin Oils Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of China's state-owned backbone grain and oil enterprise, Sinograin. In 2017, soybean imports from Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay accounted for 69.4 percent of the company's total soybean imports, while imports from the U.S. only accounted for 30.6 percent of the total. In fact, the distribution of China's soybean sources has been changing since long before the recent trade friction. Statistics from China's customs service show that in 2016 and 2017, soybeans imported by China from non-U.S. countries, mainly South America, accounted for over 60 percent of China's total soybean imports, and has since grown steadily. Relevant statistics indicate that although U.S. exports make up 35 percent of China's total soybean imports, they account for a much larger 60 percent of the United States' total soybean exports. ""Farmers in the U.S. are the real victims of the high tariff policy of the U.S. government"", said Yu. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has denounced the Lira crisis as a ""plot against Turkey,"" warning that his country will forge new alliances and markets in response to a bitter rift with long-time ally the United States, which has caused the Turkish currency to hit record lows. (Xinhua/Turkish Presidential Palace) ANKARA, Aug. 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has denounced the Lira crisis as a ""plot against Turkey,"" warning that his country will forge new alliances and markets in response to a bitter rift with long-time ally the United States, which has caused the Turkish currency to hit record lows. ""ECONOMIC WAR"" ""The fluctuation in the Turkish Lira is a plot against Turkey, but the Turkish people will not give in,"" the Turkish president defiantly said on Sunday in a live speech in northwestern province of Trabzon, sharply criticizing the United States of waging an ""economic war"" against his country. Relations between the United States and Turkey had plunged to their lowest in decades following unprecedented sanctions declared by the United States on Turkey over U.S. pastor Andrew Brunson, who faces terrorism charges and up to 35 years in prison if found guilty. Turkey scrambled a delegation to Washington last week to stave off the crisis but no deal has been reached. U.S. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said on Thursday that although the two sides ""had wide-ranging meetings at the State Department and with other departments here in Washington,"" the U.S. side ""would define progress as Pastor Brunson being brought home."" Erdogan vowed also in Trabzon there would be no easing of the law in Brunson's case, said that the United States tried to ""give us ultimatums and deadlines to free the priest. We have not made concessions on justice so far, and we will never make any."" The Turkish Lira has slide rapidly since the United States slapped sanctions on two Turkish ministers, and extended its slide Monday morning to a new record low, at over 6.8 to U.S. dollar at the opening of European and Turkish markets. ""I here declare that we have seen your plot and we are challenging it,"" said Erdogan. ""There is no economic reason for the present (currency plunge) situation. This a plot to force Turkey to surrender in every field from finance to politics, to make Turkey and its people to kneel down."" The Turkish strongman also pointed out that Turkey was considering other markets and political alternatives to its ""strategic partnership"" with Washington. ""If you come at us with your dollars we will try to find other ways to manage our affairs. We will respond to those, who declared trade war on the entire world and included Turkey in it, by steering towards new alliances, new markets,"" he said. In addition, Erdogan also threatened the United States to ""start looking for new friend and allies,"" if the row isn't resolved soon. ""Washington must give up the misguided notion that our relationship can be asymmetrical and come to terms with the fact that Turkey has alternatives,"" wrote the Turkish strongman in the New York Times on Saturday. ""You (the United States) are trying to sacrifice our strategic relations on the sole basis of a priest,"" said Erdogan Sunday, warning furthermore that Turkey will eventually say ""farewell"" to its American ally. ACTION PLAN Turkey has drafted an economic action plan and has started implementing it ""as of tonight"" to ease investor concerns, Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak tweeted Sunday night. Albayrak described the Lira's weakness as ""an attack,"" echoing President Erdogan, who is his father-in-law. Albayrak also announced a plan has been prepared for banks and the real economy, including small to mid-sized businesses which are most affected by the foreign exchange fluctuations. Albayrak dismissed any suggestions that Turkey might intervene in dollar-denominated bank accounts, saying any seizure or conversion of those deposits into Lira was out of the question. The Turkish central bank announced Monday morning for its part a list of measures in which banks will be provided all the liquidity they need in light of the currency plunge, ""to support the effective functioning of financial markets."" Erdogan rejected speculation that Turkey would seek a rescue package from the International Monetary Found. TRADE SANCTIONS U.S. President Donald Trump announced a punitive doubling of tariff rates on steel and aluminum products from Turkey to 50 percent and 20 percent respectively. ""Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!"" Trump tweeted. The United States is the biggest destination for Turkish steel exports with 11 percent of the Turkish export volume. And as Turkey is heavily dependent for its energy imports, consumers will suffer from imminent price hikes, said analysts. On Friday, Erdogan called on its citizens to convert their hard currency and gold into lira to prop up the plunging currency with a ""domestic and national stance."" The Lira has lost more that 45 percent of its value against dollar this year not only because of the latest diplomatic rift, bus also due to the Turkish economy showing signs of vulnerability after years of continued growth. The falling Lira would hit Turkish companies that have to repay foreign currency debt estimated at more than 200 billion U.S. dollars. Turkey has weathered several tough economic crises over the decades. Erdogan himself was elected prime minister in 2003 on the back of a major crisis two years earlier, but has traditionally always had Washington's staunch support. Turkey and the United States have disagreed on a number of issues in recent years, including the war in Syria and a U.S. refusal to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a cleric Erdogan claims is behind the botched attempt to unseat him. The Trump administration has imposed sanctions against several countries in recent months, including Turkey, Iran and Russia. Washington's hostility against Ankara has fueled speculations that it would further push Turkey towards Russia. The two countries already cooperate regarding Syria and have established close energy and trade ties. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is to hold talks on Monday in Ankara with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu, focusing on bilateral ties and the Syrian crisis in the midst of escalating tensions between Ankara and Washington."

Like a bull on rage, todayâs Uncle Sam is trampling upon international rules and damaging the current global trade system and economic globalization. The White House unreasonably requested China to reduce hundreds of billions of US dollars of trade deficits, despite of the truth that China is seeing a large decline in the ratio of the current account surplus in its GDP and continuing to expand openness and lower tariffs. China has already become a market economy, but the US ignored the fact and even declared that Chinaâs countermeasures are unreasonable. The US also made troubles within the World Trade Organization (WTO), saying it has been treated unequally and suffering losses in global trade. It even threatened to quit the organization. What the US did has cast shadow on the international trade, and its practices revealed the countryâs philosophy to exploit whatâs useful and abandon the rest. In recent years, the US has privatized international rules and did whatever it wanted in an arbitrary manner. The country, for instance, changed and upgraded global trade and investment rules just to protect its own core competitiveness. In addition, it raised thresholds in intellectual property, investor-country dispute settlement, and trade services to tailor for its own profits, and made more self-oriented international trade rules to keep its advantages and guarantee that the development of global economic governance still serves American interests. Letâs just say that the US acquired these favorable conditions and advantages through multilateral negotiations under the current international economic and trade orders, but the âAmerican firstâ strategy is totally going against the global trade rules. The so-called âAmerica firstâ is nothing but merely egoism, as well as supremacy-supported bully practice that challenges multilateral cooperation and global rules. The proposal of the âAmerica firstâ is the start of the US violation of international rules. In a word, the strategy aims to abandon current rules and put domestic laws above international laws, which means the US can replace global trade dispute settlement mechanism with unilateral move. It is especially obvious in economy and trade. By withdrawing from Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, renegotiating on the North American Free Trade Agreement, and initiating the Section 201, 232 and 301 investigations, the US is forcing its trade partners to sacrifice themselves just to âmake America great againâ. Such concept, which is seemingly maximizing US interests, will only weaken the leadership and influence of the US in the international community, and fail to solve the problems of the country. It will also slow the world economy. US international trade expert Steve Suranovic once warned that the international rules are on the edge of collapse and the common interests would disappear if other countries stop cooperating with the US, and the âAmerica firstâ may devolve into âeveryone lastâ. Driven by the âAmerica firstâ strategy, the former initiator, designer, and advocate for international rules has now become a total breaker, objector and subverter. Such turnabout is not arbitrariness, but supremacy. According to incomplete statistics, the Trump administration launched 94 investigations into alleged unfair trading practices from dozens of countries over the past year, up 81 percent year on year. The report on WTO dispute adjudication also indicated that the US is so far the largest rule breaker which was involved in 2/3 of the violations the multilateral body has ever seen. In addition, the US also held hostage the nomination of the WTO appellate body, leading to a breakdown of dispute-settlement mechanism and endangering the multilateral trading system. From a historical perspective, economic globalization is an objective demand for social productivity development and a natural result of scientific innovation. It is injecting strong impetus to global economic growth, promoting the flow of goods and capital, and accelerating the progress of technology and civilization. Each economy has been more or less integrated into the global industrial and value chains, depending on each other. The current multilateral economic and trade rules serve as a foundation for global trade. The cake of global wealth growth will be made bigger if each party abides the rules, otherwise the prosperity and development of the world will be hurt. The repeated mistakes of the US unilateral practices are the largest threat against the global industrial chain and value chain, and are being resisted and condemned by more and more countries. Without the international rules, the US will not only fail to achieve the so-called âAmerica firstâ, but also make the world go back to a state of isolation and destroy the hard-won process of globalization. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Han, who is also the deputy director of the office of the central agricultural work leading group, said that although the White House and the US Department of Agriculture declared a $12 billion bailout to help US farmers weather the trade war, the latter would still face the risk of losing Chinese market on which they had invested decades of efforts. China decided to impose 25 percent tariff on $34 billion worth of US imports including agricultural products as a countermeasure after the US released a list of Chinese exports worth the same value facing extra tariffs on July 6, Han noted. Soybeans are the most important products in China-US agricultural trade. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), last month, predicted a general global balance of soybean supply and demand in 2018, while the US soybean production is estimated at 117.79 million tons this year, down by 1.5 percent from that of the 2017. The US exported 59 percent of its total soybean production to China in the last three years, and is estimated to ship over 30 million tons of soybeans to China in 2018 if the trade friction didnât happen. However, most Chinese enterprises stopped their soybean purchases from the US since China declared to slap 25 percent tariff on the US soybeans on July 6. The influence will be expanded when the soybeans gradually hit the market this October. The price drop, increased export pressure, as well as the prolonged export cycle would all bring losses to the US soybean growers, and also unfavorable results to the international trade and industrial development of the US soybeans. According to monitoring data, the soybean futures price has experienced a nearly 20 percent plunge upon Chinaâs proposal to impose 25 percent tariff on the US crop early this April. The US and the EU, in a joint statement issued after the meeting between US President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on July 25, reached a consensus that the EU will increase soybean imports from the US. The 28 EU members imported about 13.65 million tons of US-grown soybeans in 2017, and their maximum import volume of US soybeans was only 5.5 million tons during the period from 2012 to 2016. OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook predicted that the EUâs annual soybean import will stand at 13 to 14 million tons in the next decade. Even if all of this volume comes from the US, the US will not be able to make up the loss of the huge amount of soybeans that could have been exported to China, let alone it is impossible for EU to import all the soybeans from the US. The open hearing held by the US House of Representatives on July 19 also indicated the concerns of the US society over the loss of market share, as the share on the Chinese market is a hard-won result after years of operation by the US industry associations of soybean, cereal, dairy products, meat, aquatic products, fruit and nuts. Han said that Chinese market of agricultural products is of fierce competition where the US products have to face higher cost if the trade friction continues to escalate. As a result, the share of US products will be largely reduced and finally be taken by their rivals. It will be hard for the US to regain the Chinese market once the other countries become reliable suppliers for China, the official said, adding that it is the last thing that the US agricultural industry hopes to see, and they donât want their long-term interests to be damaged by the tariff policy. âIn China, it took 36 years of trying to build up markets and relationships with marketers,"" said US Soybean Export Council CEO Jim Sutter, while Brazilian Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, and Supply Blairo Maggi expressed that his country is capable of doubling the cultivated area of soybeans which currently stands at 85 million acres. What the US agricultural industry values is the huge market in China, just as what has been said in the letter to the US trade representative Robert Lighthizer written by the US Wheat Associates and other US farm organizations: lost market share is incredibly difficult to regain. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Photo by Zheng Qi from Peopleâs Daily âThe customer just left,â said Kraig Baumann, an American ginseng producer in Wisconsin, after he lost a potential buyer due to the recent tariff policies issued by the US government. Baumann runs the largest American ginseng farm in Wisconsin that covers about 500 acres of land. He has been engaged in ginseng growing for 45 years, and his farm produces 250,000 pounds of the plant each year. Baumann was still an ambitious man during an interview with the Peopleâs Daily last November, saying he would expand overseas business. He also showed around the newly-built staff dorms to the journalist with pride. He would print QR codes on the package of his ginsengs sold to China, and he said it was a special design for the customers on the other side of the ocean. 95 percent of American ginsengs of the US come from Wisconsin. Meanwhile, 85 percent of the stateâs production goes to Asia, 80 percent of which ends up in mainland China and Hong Kong. However, the current China-US trade dispute is placing huge impact on the stateâs American Ginseng industry. âImposing the tariffs brings no good to anyone,â said Baumann. He introduced that their business was great with continuously growing export before the US adopted the tariff policy. However, the farmers now have to offer high discounts in order to retain their customers. As a result, the farmers are suffering losses and cannot afford to purchase new equipment and hire new employees, Baumann told Peopleâs Daily. âIt is disappointing,â he said. Apart from the American ginseng industry, the cranberry growers in the state do not want the trade war, either. A lorry loaded with soybeans on a farm in Illinois. Photo by Zheng Qi from Peopleâs Daily Statistics released by the Wisconsin State Cranberry Growers Association (WSCGA) indicated that the US exports about 95 million pounds of cranberries, or 12 percent of its total production to the European Union (EU) each year. However, the EU is now levying extra tariff on the US plant as a retaliatory measure against the US government who increased import duties on EU steel and aluminum products. In addition, 90 percent of Wisconsinâs milk is sold out-state after being manufactured into cheese. The milk price, which experienced a dramatic decline in 2014 from a record high, has already impacted many of the US dairy farms. Recently, the industry was further threatened after Mexico announced to slap a 25 percent of tariff on US dairy products as retaliation to the US steel and aluminum tariff policy. Mexico is the largest export market of the US dairy products, with nearly $400 million of imports last year. Not a single state is spared from the damage, with the industrial Midwest and the agricultural heartland states hit especially hard, according to the latest research report by the US Chamber of Commerce (USCC). The report said that the increased tariff has caused damages to the whole US business world, from agriculture to industries, from Wisconsin to the rest of the states. The US-initiated trade war will bring impact to over $1 billion worth of the export industry in Wisconsin, casting shadow on about 800,000 jobs in international trade. The damage will only become worse. Although the US government recently announced an agricultural subsidy plan worth $12 billion to aid the domestic farmers and ranchers whose interests have been hurt by the trade disputes, it is only a makeshift. âWe want free trade. Any aid program, no matter how massive, is nothing but band-aid,â said Bill Gordon, a soybean grower in Minnesota. He believes that the best way to stop the trade war from hurting the US economy is to put an end to the trade war. President and CEO of USCC Thomas J. Donohue recently published an article, saying that the Trump administration has slapped billions of dollarsâ worth of tariffs on imports from around the world, provoking retaliatory actions from other nations and boomeranging back to hit US businesses and consumers. He also stressed that the cumulative effect of the retaliatory tariffs could eventually stunt the economic progress of the US. âWe like neither trade war nor tariff war. It will affect everyoneâs life.â Many Americans expressed their concerns about the trade war. From agricultural to manufacturing industry, all walks of the US society have felt the impact of the tariffs. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The US envoy condemned Chinese economy and called it âAlice in Wonderlandâ. However, had Shea recalled the practices of the US in both the past and the modern time while labeling China as the âmost protectionist and mercantilist economy in the worldâ? The US enjoys a long history of protectionism and mercantilism. The infant industry argument was exactly proposed by the first US Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton in the Report on Manufactures published in 1791. The UK was the worldâs strongest country from late 18th century to mid-19th century, and also the cradle of Laissez-faire. The US, in its early years, had an edge in agriculture rather than industries. It should have followed the proposition of Thomas Jefferson who gave credit to comparative advantages, which conformed to both the views of the UK at that time and the modern US. However, the Americans didnât follow the UKâs theory, but the latterâs practices. In addition, the US approved the notorious Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930 in response to the Great Depression, substantially improving import duties on over 20,000 categories of foreign products. The act received immediate opposition from the USâs trading partners and led to a dramatic drop of global trading volume from $36 billion in 1929 to $12 billion in 1932. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act not only exacerbated the recession, but also hurt the interests of the US itself. The irony was that, Reed Smoot and Willis C. Hawley, both initiators of the act, failed in the following congressional election. Why is the US trying to hide its history and burning the bridge? Itâs a question that Washington doesnât want to and canât answer. However, it is obvious that the US doesnât want to see the developing countries âcross the riverâ through the bridge so that it can continue to take control of the world. So far, China and the US have adopted completely different attitudes toward free trade and multilateral trading system. The US is waving the tariff stick in front of China, as well as its traditional allies including the European Union, Japan, Mexico and Canada, while China promotes WTO reform, advocates settlement of trade disputes through multilateral frameworks, and continuously lowers tariffs on imported goods. China fulfilled its promise for WTO membership of lowering average tariff to less than 10 percent ahead of the scheduled time. At present, Chinaâs trade-weighted average tariff is only 4.4 percent, and the effective rate is even as low as 2.4 percent. In addition, by July 29 this year, China has had a total of 2,652 non-tariff barriers, much lower than 5,452 of the US, according to the Integrated Trade Intelligence Portal of the WTO. Is there something that can prove Chinaâs economic model is damaging the global trade? Or is Chinaâs development model reducing global trade volume or quality? If not, why did Ambassador Shea remarked that China is hurting the world? On the contrary, China has never groundlessly belittled the unique contribution made by other countries although it is making more and more contribution to the world economy. The following set of data should be repeated, though the US refused to recognize them every time. China has maintained medium to high speed of economic development, becoming an indispensable engine for global economic recovery and sustainable development. According to the countryâs National Bureau of Statistics, China secured an average annual growth of 7.2 percent from 2013 to 2016, much higher than that of the three major developed economies of the US, the Eurozone, and Japan, and outrunning that of the global economy which stood at 2.7 percent in the same period. China lent a powerful hand to the growth of global economy, contributing an average of over 30 percent to the world economic growth in those four years. As a matter of fact, the countryâs GDP only accounted for 1.8 percent of the worldâs total back in 1978. Chinaâs economic development has created opportunities for other countries through trade. On one hand, Chinaâs exportation of the large volume of fine products at reasonable prices to many countries including the US enriched the latterâs choices and lowered input costs; on the other hand, Chinaâs rapidly growing demand for imports is also making more and more contribution to the prosperity of global trade and promoting the rebalance of world economy. World Bank statistics indicated that the global share of the goods and services exported and imported by China grew to 9.7 percent in 2016 from 8.4 percent in 2011, while that of the US, the Eurozone, and Japan together saw a drop of 0.4 percentage points. The contribution China has made to the world also won the country a good reputation. During the seventh trade policy review of China, the WTO representatives generally believed that China has created opportunities for the world development through its economic development and trade policies in recent years, giving full recognition to the country in this regard. They also expressed high appreciation toward such opportunities, and confirmed the progress that China has made in fulfilling WTO obligations.

Located at the Hangzhou bay, Yangshan deep water port boosts Shanghai as an international maritime shipping center. [Photo/Xinhua] When US President Donald Trump made his first state visit to China in November last year, agreements between the United States and China related to liquefied natural gas amounted to tens of billions of dollars. The deals were touted by Trump at the time as a big win for his visit. But now, if China's proposed 25 percent tariff on US LNG takes effect, either they will be off the table or US and Chinese companies alike will suffer financially if they stick to the deals. China's tariff proposal is in retaliation for Trump's proposed new round of tariffs on Chinese goods. The situation has the energy industry in both countries worried, said Barry Worthington, executive director of the Washington-based United States Energy Association. Among the deals that might be in jeopardy, the US state of Alaska and Alaska Gasline Development Corp signed a memorandum of understanding with China Petrochemical Corp, China Investment Corp and Bank of China for deals valued at $43 billion. Houston-based Cheniere Energy and China National Petroleum Corp signed long-term LNG sale and purchase agreements valued at more than $10 billion. In addition, the LNG deal between Delfin Midstream and China Gas Holdings was valued at $8 billion. Worthington, who was in Beijing last week for the International Energy Forum, described the mood there as ""a lot of nervousness because no one is sure what will happen with the tariff"". ""You have some people on both the Chinese and US sides who are convinced that the tariff is going to take effect and have terrific impact on both countries. There are others who think that people on both sides are negotiating a package and that, at the end of the day, there will either be no tariff or a tariff for a very short period of time. The opinion is a 50-50 split on both the US and China sides."" If the tariff takes effect and remains, the impact will be significant, said Worthington. ""There are multiple buyers and sellers in the global market, Chinese buyers will find other sources, US producers will find other buyers, but neither side will be happy,"" he said. ""You will see price adjustment on both sides. US producers sell at lower price, and Chinese buyers are likely required to buy at higher price. Neither side wins with a tariff."" With the price of crude oil currently around $70 a barrel, drilling activity in western Texas, cooled by the price slump two years ago, has been booming since the beginning of this yearï¼though that could change due to the tariff spat between the US and China. Li Shaolin, president of PetroChina International America, a Houston-based subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corp, said the proposed tariffs list includes not only LNG, but also many other oil-and gas-related chemical products. The tariffs will have a profound impact on the US energy sector, Li said. ""The US has to look for other markets around the globe, and this will lower their competitiveness in the global market, consequently impacting oil and gas production,"" Li said. It will also force China to look for products elsewhere. ""It will affect our business of exporting US crude oil to China,"" Li said. With China's policy shift to cleaner energy, anticipated US LNG exports to China and elsewhere prompted construction of a few large LNG terminal projects. These will be affected by the tariffs, said Worthington. There are currently two LNG export terminals in the USï¼one in Maryland and one in Louisiana. They are loading shipments as quickly as possible, according to Worthington. Four more LNG export terminals are under constructionï¼one each in Georgia and Louisiana and two in Texasï¼and are expected to begin operating by the end of 2019. ""Those are multibillion dollar investments. Once completed, they will look for export cargoes as quickly as they can. The real impact of a tariff will come out for the next few terminals. If the tariff takes effect, those future terminals might have trouble getting financed,"" Worthington said. Despite the potential tariff threat, Worthington said he is optimistic. ""People in the industries and governments are very aware of the negative consequence of tariffs on the energy sector. Before both governments allow that to happen, they will find a mutually useful deal for citizens on both sides,"" Worthington predicted. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

(Xinhua/Yang Chenglin) WASHINGTON, Aug. 9 (Xinhua) -- Raising tariffs against imports is not the right way to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which is likely to increase further because of the planned U.S. fiscal stimulus, International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief economist Maurice Obstfeld has said. The United States is misguided to impose new tariffs on various imports valued at hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars in a bid to reduce the country's massive trade deficit, Obstfeld said in a recent interview with Xinhua. MISGUIDED PERCEPTIONS OF TRADE DEFICITS ""It seems intuitive that if I have an import tariff, I will import less and my current account will improve,"" said Obstfeld, economic counselor and director of the Research Department at the IMF. ""That's really misguided because the effects are really complex. If I have an import tariff, my currency might strengthen, which is in fact what economic theory predicts,"" Obstfeld said. In Obstfeld's view, the U.S. dollar, viewed widely as a safe-haven currency, is likely to rise further as the United States imposes more tariffs on imports. That will make American exports more expensive for the rest of the world. As U.S. exports decline and imports increase, the U.S. trade deficit will increase further. The planned fiscal stimulus, large tax cuts and increased government spending will also temporarily boost domestic demand and imports, leading to a higher U.S. trade deficit, said Obstfeld, one of the world's leading experts on international economics. Therefore, ""trade policies don't have major quantitatively measurable impact on current account imbalances, which are mainly a macroeconomic phenomenon,"" he said. Based on current fiscal measures, the IMF estimated that the U.S. current account deficit, which is mainly made up of the trade deficit, would rise to 3.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2020 from 2.4 percent in 2017. ""If there were a further tax cut, that number would rise even further, perhaps 4 percent of GDP or beyond,"" Obstfeld said. As the United States has an overall current account deficit, it's natural that the country tends to have bilateral trade deficits with a number of trading partners. But these bilateral trade deficits don't indicate that other trading partners cheat the United States on trade or it loses from trade, said Obstfeld. ""On the contrary, the bilateral balances are a critical part of how the U.S. actually gains from trade,"" he argued, citing examples that imports of aluminum could end up being built into U.S. aircraft that are exported all over the world. ""One of the big ways all countries gained from trade is from a more efficient international division of labor, where each country does what it does relatively best,"" he said. TRADE, NOT ZERO-SUM GAME Obstfeld, who will retire from the IMF at the end of December and return to the University of California, Berkeley, firmly believes that international trade is a ""positive-sum game."" ""If you treat it as a zero-sum game, you may end up with a negative-sum game and the kind of risks of a trade war that we're seeing today,"" he said, warning that severe trade restrictions would adversely affect productivity, investment and confidence. ""I think countries should really step back and think about what their goals are and negotiate on a multilateral basis,"" said the IMF chief economist, calling for strengthening the World Trade Organization (WTO) and rules-based multilateral trading system. If current trade disputes are not resolved peacefully, U.S. stock markets and business investment will eventually ""adjust downward and we will see stronger negative effects,"" he said. NO FURTHER FISCAL STIMULUS NEEDED While Republicans in the House of Representatives are working with the government on another round of tax cuts before the mid-term elections, Obstfeld sees no need for further fiscal stimulus. ""The U.S. is at or maybe even beyond the full employment point and there's no need for further fiscal stimulus. In fact, we would like to see the U.S. going to the opposite direction,"" he said. ""It should really think about rebuilding fiscal buffers and having those in place so that it can act when the next recession comes,"" Obstfeld said, adding the United States needs ""a stronger long-term fiscal position"" in the face of an aging population. An additional round of tax cuts would widen the U.S. current account deficit, ""possibly stoking more trade tensions"" and leading the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more quickly, he said. ""We know that eventually there will be another economic slowdown and at that point fiscal stimulus may be appropriate, but that would even increase the debt further,"" he said. Federal debt could grow to double the size of the U.S. economy in 30 years if Congress extends tax cuts and continues the recently enacted spending increases, according to a report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released on Wednesday."

Despite the plan by the administration of US President Donald Trump for up to $12 billion in subsidies for US farmers and the initial agreement with the European Union to increase imports of US soybeans to Europe, the US farm sector will suffer greatly due to the loss of the huge Chinese market, said Han Jun, deputy head of the Office of the Central Leading Group for Rural Affairs and vice-minister of agriculture and rural affairs, in an interview on Thursday. However, China does not want to see the escalation of China-US trade friction, and most people in the two countries do not want trade relations between the two countries to reach a stalemate, he said. ""Negotiation is the only way to resolve trade disputes between the two countries,"" he said. ""For China, the door for negotiation will not close. China will pay attention to US concerns in agriculture, but the US should not make unreasonably high demands on China."" In response to the US imposition of rising tariffs on Chinese goods, China has since July 6 begun to levy additional 25 percent tariffs on 517 types of agricultural products â including soybeans, cotton and pork â imported from the US. The total value of these imports last year was about $21 billion, Han said. Last week, China announced that it might levy different levels of additional tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion, in response to US threats to impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods worth $200 billion. Han said the list will include 387 kinds of agricultural products, so almost all agricultural products from the US will face additional tariffs once the latest countermeasures by China take effect. ""China made the countermeasures after extensively soliciting opinions and careful evaluations of the effects, and they are rational and restrained,"" he said. Han said China and the US are strongly complementary in agricultural trade. ""China has huge demand for import of agricultural products, with its population growth and rising living standards of its people, and it will keep expanding imports,"" he said. ""We hope to see a healthy agricultural trade relations between the two countries, so US farmers also get benefits. However, the US has kept escalating trade frictions, regardless of a consensus already made between the two countries."" Han said China will closely evaluate the effects caused by its countermeasures to the tariff measures imposed by the US to minimize their impact on domestic production and people's livelihood. ""Levying additional tariffs will cause a great decrease in the export of US agricultural products to China,"" he said. ""But the impact on China is very limited, due to multiple import resources for China."" ""If a trade war breaks out between China and the US, many other countries will be willing and able to replace the US share of agricultural products in the Chinese market."" Escalation of trade frictions between the two countries will result in higher costs for US agricultural products entering China, and the US share of the market will be significantly reduced, which will favor its competitors, he said. ""Once other countries have become reliable suppliers of agricultural goods for China, it will be very difficult for the US agricultural producers to regain the Chinese market,"" he said. Han said additional tariffs would cause a great decrease in China's imports of soybeans from the US, the most important product of China-US agriculture trade. But China is fully prepared and is capable of bridging the gap in reduced supply from the US through various measures, including increasing imports from other countries, promoting alternatives to animal feed made of soybeans in the poultry and husbandry industries to reduce domestic consumption of soybeans, and increasing domestic planting of soybeans, he said. China relies on imports for most of its soybean consumption, with the US being the second-largest source of imports for China, after Brazil. Nearly 60 percent of all exported soybeans from the US went to China between 2015 and last year. China could reduce imports of soybeans by more than 10 million metric tons this year â down by more than 10 percent from last year â because of expanding domestic production and the promotion of soybean substitutes, Chinese experts have predicted. Han said China may also increase soybean imports from countries such as Brazil to meet its increasing demand. Han also said China and the US had some fruitful negotiations on agricultural trade in June, during which the two sides reached initial agreements that China would increase imports of US agricultural products by a large margin. However, the US unilaterally provoked conflicts, so the negotiation achievements have become invalid, he said. Despite the agreement by the EU to import more soybeans from the US, it is estimated that the EU could only import between 13 million and 14 million metric tons of soybeans each year over the next 10 years â compared with more than 30 million metric tons imported from the US by China last year â so it would be impossible for the US to handle all the soybeans in surplus, Han said. ""People of all walks of life in agriculture in the US have expressed worries over losing the Chinese market,"" he said. The additional tariff measures carried out on July 6 by the US did not include agricultural products imported from China, but most aquatic products, fruits and vegetables exported to the US will be covered by a second round of tariff measures likely to be imposed by the US, which would involve Chinese goods with a total value of $200 billion, Han said. The Chinese government will take measures such as helping producers to find alternative export destinations and exploring domestic market opportunities to minimize the impact, he said.

The newly imposed tariffs will be officially implemented since Aug. 23. A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) condemned the US on Wednesday for once again putting domestic law above international law by imposing very unreasonable new tariffs on Chinese goods. He said China has decided to impose an additional tariff of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of US goods and will implement it in parallel with the US. The second shot fired by the US is totally within the expectation of China, so the latter has grown more sophisticated in handling this issue. However, there are still something new that are worth paying attention to. The initial tariff list released by the US covered 284 product categories while this time the number was reduced by 5 to 279. The US side knows that it will suffer great economic losses if not removing additional tariffs on the 5 categories. It indicates that the US is seeing increasing difficulties in attacking China without hurting itself. In addition, the second round of tariff imposition received objection from related American industries immediately after it was announced. ""We have made the case to the administration, in the strongest possible terms, that tariffs imposed on semiconductors imported from China will hurt America's chipmakers, not China's,"" President and CEO of the US Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) John Neuffer said in a statement. The US farmers used to be Donald Trumpâs firm supporters, but now more and more of them are feeling being betrayed. Tweets against the US-China trade war have spammed the twitter page of the American Soybean Association. Besides, according to the latest statistics from the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, the US trade deficit with China continued expanding in the first half of 2018 to $185.7 billion, up 9 percent year on year. It indicates that the US will not be able to reduce trade deficits by starting a trade war against China. It has been a month since the trade war was initiated, and the performances of the two sides are in sharp contrast. The US has been acting arbitrarily while China shows restraint and rationality. What the US has done is just aggravate its blackmail from $50 billion, to $200 billion, and then the totally unrealistic $500 billion. It exerted extreme high pressure on China just to crumble the latter. However, such simple and crude method obviously had no effect on the handling of the interwoven trade relations between the US and China. On the contrary, Chinaâs practices have always been rational and restrained. The US has been acting impetuously while China adopts a calm mindset. The core decision makers of the US trade are making remarks almost every day to boost their courage, revealing their wishful thinking of ending the trade war with one-time effort. China, by contrast, is fighting back in self-defense and dealing with the issue with calmness, as it showcases the resolution to keep its head up and fight till the end. The US has been acting unfaithfully while China always keeps its words. This round of trade game between the two major economies exposed how the US has broken its promises to both China and the world. China has always made concise and explicit remarks, and its actions always followed its words. The US has been acting irresponsibly while China always bears in mind the bigger picture. The US is the only super power in the world, and the establishment of the modern global trading system was exactly guided by the country. However, Washington traded the world trading system and rules for private interests, which has led to unanimous critics from the international community. China always stands with the multilateral trade system and rules, paying attention to the interests of the whole. Obviously, Washington failed to act like a responsible major country in this trade war, but China still showcased its consistent calmness and composure even under the pressure placed by the US. The ancient Chinese divination text I Ching, also known as the Classic of Changes, said that even a dragon regrets flying too high, and fullness wonât last long. Based on such ancient oriental wisdom, Washingtonâs practices are not able to be sustained. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

To safeguard its interests and the multilateral trading system, China was forced to make countermeasures. It opted to impose 25 percent tariff on $16 billion worth of US imports, and the tariff is to be implemented in parallel with the US. The Trump administration insisted on starting a trade war against China and escalated the trade war step by step, attempting to force China into trade concessions through extreme oppression and blackmail. However, Chinaâs reaction indicates its comprehensive understanding of the trade war, which enables it to handle with calmness. China knows that the trade war is inevitable. The US is unwilling to see China develop and prosper and then surpass it; therefore it devotes great efforts to maintain its long-time hegemony and the so-called strategic advantages. The US wants to profit from its economic and trade relations with China, and it wants more to contain Chinaâs development. The Trump administration regards China as its âstrategic competitorâ which âthreatensâ the US in terms of geopolitics, strategic security, economy and trade and technology, as well as ideology. Its China policy, based on zero-sum mentality, will not change as China hopes it to. Therefore, China has to cast away illusions and resolutely respond to the US. China has seen through the double-dealing of the US. The US always treats China with two contrary approaches. It on one hand wants to contact, talk and cooperate with China and on the other hand guards against and oppresses the latter and couldnât stop containing and confronting the latter. The Trump administrationâs China policy is unconventional and changeable, but it is still a double-faced tactic. In these days, while announcing to increase tariffs on imported Chinese goods, the US also expressed its willingness to resume negotiations with China. In response to this carrot-and-stick diplomacy, China insists on taking reciprocal counteractions through promoting negotiations while fighting the trade war. China knows that the trade war is tough, and it grants more composure for the country. Inflicted with the largest-ever trade war in world economic history, China will inevitably suffer economic and trade losses, and be confronted with new difficulties in national economic transformation. But just as jade needs to be polished, China also needs to go through trials and tribulations to be strong. No hardship has ever stopped China from standing up, growing rich and becoming strong. Any external pressure will ultimately be turned into strong impetus for development. Chinaâs development is not a handout from other countries, and it has the ability to withstand pressures from external powers. It will calmly face this obstacle on the course of its rising and accept this test that a major country has to encounter on the path of development. China sees both the dark and bright sides of the trade war. The country has a belief that challenges can be turned into opportunities. Provoked by the US, China will fight back with wisdom and courage, stay restrained and adopt a long-term prospective. In the US-China trade war, China upholds justice and follows the trends of global development. The country will never be complacent or fear the US. China will continue upholding reform and opening up and focusing on its own development, as well as adhering to peaceful development. By doing this, the country will finally turn risks into opportunities and walk faster toward high-quality development. With a long history and profound strategic culture, China has gained rich experience in the fight against foreign forces. In the 1930s and 1940s, Chairman Mao Zedong said âthe War of Resistance against Japan is a protracted war and the final victory will be oursâ this is our conclusionâ, after in-depth analysis on issues concerning the War. In the 1980s and 1990s, western countries represented by the US imposed sanctions on China, casting shadow on the latterâs future. However, the chief architect of China's economic reform Deng Xiaoping firmly believed that nothing could defeat China. History has proved that China was not defeated and put into chaos; instead, it is developing more rapidly and better. Faced with complicated domestic and international environments, Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed that the country should maintain its strategic composure and have a calm mind in the face of major challenges. He also clearly pointed out that we should not allow our views to be blocked by intricate developments in observing the world. China is unprecedentedly approaching the center of the international arena, and getting closer to realize the rejuvenation of the nation, while the world is going through unprecedented changes. At this critical moment, a keen insight, a clear mind, decisiveness, and a strong execution will guarantee China to win the trade war and forge ahead. Perhaps China and the US will not know each other better without the trade war. In history, the two countries have been in conflicts for many times. Trumpâs tactic of oppressing, blackmailing, denigrating and demonizing China will not work at all.

China's consumer price index, a major barometer of inflation, rose 2.1 percent year-on-year in July, exceeding expectations of 1.9 percent but staying well within the government's preset annual target of ""around 3 percent"", according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics released on Thursday. Analysts pointed out that robust domestic consumption activity and summer travel season demand resulted in the monthly CPI figure, as consumption strength backed price increases in transportation, tourism and other service-related sectors. Such factors should not result in significantly higher prices in the second half of the year, and the full-year result will be within a reasonable range, analysts said, adding tit-for-tat tariffs and accelerating trade disputes between China and the US will have limited influence on prices. Niu Li, an economist at the State Information Center, said CPI increases might lose steam in the second half of the year, and for the whole year the index should remain at around 2 percent. Tariffs that the US plans to impose will suppress total demand, and prices in the months ahead will likely see downward momentum, Niu added. Agreeing with Niu, Lu Ting, chief economist at Nomura Securities, wrote in a note that planned US tariffs will squeeze demand, but ""the impact of the 25 percent tariff on $34 billion of US goods should be quite small"". Contending that the expected growth slowdown should limit a further rise in inflation, Lu said the still-muted inflation growth will provide the government with more room to roll out further easing or stimulus measures to contain any additional economic growth slowdowns. Chinese policymakers have vowed to ensure proper growth in the second half of the year, aiming to implement a more proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy while making policies more forward-looking, flexible and effective. Niu said the July CPI increase was mainly driven by rising demand and higher prices in the services sector, including the transportation and tourism industries. The increase was underpinned by the summer tourism season, China's healthcare service pricing system reforms and growth in services sector prices, with the CPI at a normal level, he said. The increase also reflected the rise in labor costs, while the influence from food prices was quite limited, he said, adding food-price increases affected CPI by about 0.03 percentage point, and nonfood price increases affected CPI by about 0.28 percentage point. According to NBS senior statistician Sheng Guoqing, nonfood prices have pushed the inflation rate higher, which recorded a 2.4 percent increase year-on-year and 0.3 percent rise month-on-month. On a yearly basis, medical and healthcare prices ticked up 4.6 percent, transport and communications prices gained 3 percent while accommodation costs rose 2.4 percent. Educational, cultural and recreational prices increased 2.3 percent. Food prices went up 0.5 percent year-on-year and edged up 0.1 percent month-on-month. The price of pork, China's staple meat, continued to slump in July, down 9.6 percent year-on-year, dragging down CPI growth by 0.24 percentage point. On a monthly basis, however, it registered a 2.9 percent increase, faster than the 1.1 percent rise in June. The producer price index, which measures costs for goods leaving factories, rose 4.6 percent in July from a year earlier, cooling from the previous month's increase of 4.7 percent. The PPI increase was higher than expected, but was mainly due to a relatively small comparative base. The index will likely keep rising in July and August, but will probably fall later, according to Niu. Xinhua contributed to this story."

Approved by the State Council, the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council has decided to impose additional duties of 25 percent on the 16-billion-dollar U.S. products after making proper adjustments to the second part of a list of the products subject to the tariffs. The additional duties will take effect at 12:01 on Aug. 23, 2018. Commenting on the decision, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce said that it is totally unreasonable for the United States to put domestic laws above international laws time and time again. To defend its legitimate rights and interests and the multilateral trade system, China was forced to take necessary countermeasures, said the spokesperson. The customs tariff commission said the list has been appropriately adjusted after taking into account the advice of related government departments, industry associations, and enterprises to best protect the interest of domestic consumers and companies. Alongside the statement, the commission published a final version of the second part of the list on the website of the Ministry of Finance. In June, the customs authority unveiled a list of products from the United States worth 50 billion U.S. dollars that will be subject to additional tariffs in response to U.S. announcement to impose additional duties on Chinese imports. Additional duties on the U.S. products in the first part of the list, worth 34 billion U.S. dollars, came into force on July 6. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

China and US are important trade partners for each other with intertwined economic interests, he pointed out. Chinese commodities have long become a part of the daily life for American citizens, and the high tariffs would place direct impact on ordinary US consumers, he said, adding that the tariff hike will also harm the interests of related retailers and downstream industries in the US. âChina, which has been forced to take counteractions, has the ability to divert its products from the US to other markets, but it will be very difficult for US enterprises to come back to China once they lose the market,â Shaimergenov noted. In recent years, China has further facilitated the interconnectivity with Belt and Road regions including the European Union and the Middle East thanks to the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative, releasing bigger potential for economic and trade cooperation, he said. âIt is because of the Initiative that Central Asia has once again become the transportation hub for Eurasia, and Kazakhstan has embraced a major opportunity for developing industrial and non-energy sectors,â Shaimergenov remarked. He told Peopleâs Daily that China enjoys a high reputation from the international community by always adhering to win-win cooperation and common development, as well as its efforts to promote economic globalization. On the contrary, the US government is going against the trend of the times by adopting the âAmerica firstâ strategy and trade protectionism. âThe easy approaches of the US to threaten China on trade issues are unpractical,â he commented. Shaimergenov believes that bilateral and multilateral economic and trade cooperation is a market practice, and the current trade pattern is a natural result of the choice made by market and consumers. Any practice to forcibly change the global economic structure is wrong, he said. âThe China-US trade friction is a complicated and systematic issue, which should not be addressed through simply increasing tariffs,â he said, adding that the US should expand exports, ease trade restrictions, and improve trade facilitation rather than the adopting a tariff boost. He pointed out that China and the US are vital economies, and their development to a large extent determines the development of global economy. âThe increasingly confident China has been acting rationally enough in the trade frictions, and I hope the US can also see the larger picture and get back to the right track to make positive efforts to safeguard global economic interests,â Shaimergenov said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The country has the confidence and ability to maintain stable and healthy economic development, Chinese experts said. On Aug. 3, China announced its decision to impose additional tariffs of four rates on 5,207 items of imported US products worth $ 60 billion. The rates of additional tariffs on such products will be 25 percent, 20 percent, 10 percent, and 5 percent, according to the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council. China will instantly implement the countermeasures if the US obstinately puts its additional tariff measures into effect, said the commission. The decision came one day after the U.S. Trade Representative proposed targets for 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, up 15 percent from that launched on July 11. China adopted the countermeasures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests as a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). They are lawful measures to safeguard the multilateral trading system and the global value chain, the experts said. The US has seriously violated WTO rules, undermined the global industrial chain and free trade system, and once again unilaterally escalated trade frictions. Its behaviors are typically trade blackmail, said Chen Wenling, chief economist at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges. That China decisively took countermeasures has demonstrated its resolution to oppose, counter and strike back at the US trade blackmail, Chen said. The tariff countermeasures were taken to save Chinaâs economy under a passive circumstance. They are to alleviate the adverse effects of US protectionist measures and safeguard interests of China and the Chinese people, said Li Chunding, head of the institute for international economics of College of Economics and Management, China Agricultural University. They have also manifested China is resolved to oppose trade protectionism and safeguard multilateral trading system, Li added. The countermeasures are reasonable actions taken under the circumstance that the US continued to intensify the China-US trade frictions, according to Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. Tu stressed that only consultation on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit is an effective way to resolve trade differences. Any unilateral threat or blackmail will only intensify trade disputes and damage the interests of all parties. âAccording to the statement of the commission, we will strive to minimize the impact of the measures on Chinaâs domestic production and peopleâs lives,â said Gao Lingyun, a research fellow of the Institute of World Economics and Politics with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. China has given full consideration to possible adverse effects of imposing the four-level tariff rates on the production of domestic enterprises and peopleâs lives, said Gao, adding that the countryâs countermeasures are resolute and strong, as well as restrained and rational. The countermeasures will not have a huge impact on Chinaâs domestic market, Chen noted, explaining that China has fully considered and estimated the possible impact on the Chinese people and enterprises. The new tax revenue from the countermeasures will be mainly used to mitigate the impact on enterprises and employees, she said. âChina has both confidence and ability to maintain stable and healthy economic development,â said Li Yong, deputy director of the China Association of International Trade Expert Committee. Chinaâs economy is stable, Li Yong said. The countryâs GDP growth reached 6.8 percent in the first half of the year, maintaining a medium-high speed of growth for 12 consecutive quarters. China has a very large market, with the final consumption expenditure contributing 78.5 percent to the national GDP growth. China, with complete industrial categories and strong motivation for innovation, is the worldâs second largest patent applicant. In addition, new business activities are continuously injecting impetus to the economy. China has been steadfastly pushing forward reform and opening up. For example, the country has been easing its market access, broadening and deepening joint construction of the Belt and Road and preparing for the first China International Import Expo. These major decisions and measures will stimulate new vitality and generate new impetus to economic development, as well as bring more sense of gain to the people, Li Yong noted. Chinaâs export of high value-added goods is growing rapidly, occupying an increasing proportion. Countries and regions participating in building the Belt and Road have become a new highlight in the export market, said Zhao Ping, director of the Department of International Trade Research at the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. Zhao added that under such circumstances, Chinaâs foreign trade will not be greatly reduced due to damaged exports to the US, and is still expected to see stable growth in the future. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

California's almond industry, projected to yield a record 2.45 billion pounds of the nuts this year, faces retaliatory tariffs in China, Turkey and India. China imported 151 million pounds of California almonds last year, making it the state's third-largest overseas market. The Chinese duty on almonds from the United States has now risen to 50 percent from 10 percent after two rounds of tariffs in April and July. ""The impact now is more anxiety, because we don't know how it's going to be in the long run,"" said Jake Wenger, an almond grower in Modesto, California, and vice-president of the Stanislaus County Farm Bureau Board. ""When you have one harvest a year, you are basically working all year spending money on pest control, fertilizer and water, and hoping that at the end of the year you make enough money to cover your costs and then make a little bit yourself. Nobody wants to work for free or lose money,"" said Wenger. The industry's two biggest concerns are importers' requests for delaying shipment on existing contracts for the 2017 crop, and an overall reduction in contracting for the new crop, said Richard Waycott, president and CEO of the Almond Board of California, a nonprofit representing more than 6,000 almond growers and processors. ""What we are seeing is uncertainty that has been in the marketplace for several months now, and it is affecting normal buyer-seller relationships,"" he said. According to the board's monthly market report, exports to China dropped in June to almost half the level seen in the same period last year. Two factors played a role in the falling shipment volume: postponement of some shipments and a record shipment last year, said Waycott. California produces almost all US commercial almonds and 82 percent of the global supply. Almonds are California's third-biggest revenue earner among commodities. The only other significant supplier to China is Australia, which negotiated a free-trade agreement with Beijing five years ago. The tariff on Australian almonds will drop to zero on Jan 1. ""I know many Chinese buyers are attempting to buy from Australia to avoid the tariffs on US products, but the volume is not sufficient to satisfy Chinese demand,"" Waycott said. ""Another impact would be if Chinese buyers switch preference to other nuts, like macadamia nuts, or hazelnuts, until the situation is resolved,"" he added. The board has been actively investing in China for about 30 years. Its consumer education program in China is the largest one outside of the US. ""We will continue to be a longtime partner in the nut business in China,"" said Waycott. From a grower's perspective, the only thing they can do to control the negative impact is to control costs, including using less fertilizer, and reducing labor costs, said Wenger. ""We get paid the price that people are willing to pay for our products,"" he said. The industry will get a better idea where prices will be within around three months, by which time the growers will be wrapping up harvest season. But they won't see the full picture until about a year from now when they get final payment, said Wenger. ""We hope by then we can have trade agreements that can get rid of the tariffs. As a grower, we lean on our elected leaders to develop trade policies that allow fluid movement of US goods and commodities into the world market,"" he said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The MOC's announcement is a firm counterattack as the US continues to threaten another 25 percent in tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods. Based on the information released from the US, tariffs on the $200 billion will take effect on September 5 or later. The implementation date of China's proposed tariffs will be determined based on US reaction, and the trade war will then reach new heights. The tariffs that have been issued from both sides reflect the current Sino-US trade structure. According to the US Department of Commerce, the US imported $505.47 billion ($434.3 billion according to China's statistics) worth of Chinese products in 2017, while China imported some $129.89 billion worth of US goods ($155.2 billion according to China's statistics). The numbers show that the US is slapping tariffs on high-value products, which can be interpreted as a form of blackmail against China. China's countermeasures are rational, and the emphasis can be found in their quantitative and qualitative aspects. The notion of a trade war is not a game, and China will not rush to compete with US numbers. However, China's countermeasures show that it will not yield to the US pressure and it will ultimately defeat such bullying tactics. China's recent counter-response is a restrained one, and the country is reserving the right and its ability to announce more against the US. China's countermeasures aim to minimize the detrimental impact on domestic production and living standards. China is balancing short-term gain with long-term interests, risk versus opportunity, along with core and marginal interests. The tax rate countermeasures were made after listening to public opinion and thoroughly evaluating potential impacts. Public welfare, domestic business stamina, maintenance of the global industrial chain, and other factors were considered when deciding each countermeasure. China's counterattack is powerful and effective. The carefully chosen tariffs on $60 billion in US goods will have a significant impact. If the US insists on fighting a trade war, China will fight back. Some companies and individuals in China and the US suffered losses during the beginning stages of the trade war. As the trade war expands, complaints have surfaced from the US side, while indignation from the China side has revealed itself. For those caught in the middle, the real victims, they know Washington has been the provocateur since day one, and China has been fighting back. The grievances that have surfaced in US society and the indignation from Chinese society are both manifestations of Washington's efforts. The trade war started when the US first began harming others which in turn hurt itself, and has lost support domestically and internationally. The US won't be able to hold on for too much longer. The Chinese market has performed well this year. GDP is up 6.8 percent, and unemployment is at an all-time low. It is predicted the trade war will have a slight influence on the domestic market for the second half of the year, but nothing too significant. The country's 1.4 billion population continues to provide enormous market potential, and China's domestic foundation will always be able to rely on that to boost economic growth. China does not want a trade war with the US, but it will fight to the end if Washington continues starting and resuming their tariff actions. If the US wants to return to the negotiating table, then a level of sincerity will need to reveal itself. For dialogue and negotiations to be effective, mutual respect that benefits both sides needs to be in place. China has no intention of bullying foreign nations, but it will take necessary countermeasures to defend the country's dignity and the interests of its people. Washington will get a taste of China's firm determination if it does not stop acting recklessly. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"
106,http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2018/0806/c90000-9488193.html,Editorial: China will not surrender to US threatening tactic,"August 06, 2018","Washington is playing double-faced tactics in the ongoing trade war. It on one hand threatened to slap a 25-percent tariff on $200 billion of imported Chinese goods after initially setting them at 10 percent, and on the other hand sent the signal through various ways that it is willing to negotiate with China. From $50 billion, to $200 billion and then the proposed $500 billion, from 10 percent to 25 percent, Washingtonâs tariff game has been seen through by China. But it created a new tactic of accelerating the trade war while advertising its willingness for talks. The mainstream opinion is that the US wants to use carrot-and-stick diplomacy to bully China into unilateral trade concessions, while some others hold that the hardliners in the White House overwhelm those calling for talks. However, both groups share the same goal: to defeat China, no matter they prefer trade war or negotiation. But there is no way for them to be satisfied. Pointing China with gun and artillery and then asking for a talk, the US showed zero sincerity. The eye-catching economic figure released recently boosted Washingtonâs confidence, making the arrogant Uncle Sam unaware of where it really is before having rounds of clash with China. It is very possible that the trade war will be escalated given that both sides have not yet reached the state of strategic stalemate. Analysts said that China suffers the largest impact at the initial phase and the US at a later one. But China will eventually defeat the trade blackmail of the US and it is impossible to force China into surrender to the US coercion. The countermeasures China took are self-defensive responses. It insisted on not firing the first shot but will hit back once it is bullied. The country has been well prepared for fighting against the rising US tariffs, but will not fight the US through a self-exhaustion approach. In whatever way the US escalates the trade war, China will react in its own way. Though China will not start a war, it is a good hand in hitting the pain points of its opponents to defend itself. Though the US appears to be big and strong, it is in fact vulnerable from inside. Washington is too paranoid and stubborn to take care of the interests of American farmers, entrepreneurs and consumers. As a matter of fact, some American firms have already been on the brim of collapse, and the farmers are severely hurt by the trade war. The additional tariffs increased production cost of American companies by more than 30 percent, pushing them to the brink of bankruptcy. The Trump administration intends to bring American firms back to the US through the trade war, but because of the high tariffs, some companies have moved overseas, such as motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson and auto maker Tesla. If Washington escalates the tariffs to $200 billion worth of imported Chinese goods, a great number of ordinary US consumers would fall into the victims of the trade war. A considerable part of names on the new proposed list are consumer goods, which means that higher duties will raise the citizensâ living costs and reduce their life quality. Certainly the opposition voices in the US will go stronger to the extent of stopping Washington from acting capriciously. China has been devoted itself to resolving disputes through dialogue. But the Chinese people no longer believe Washingtonâs sincerity for negotiations, which is also a lesson learned from the earlier rounds of negotiations with the latter. Abandoning its commitments again and again, the US has gone back on its word to both China and the world. Only mutual treatment and fulfillment to promise will lead to a dialogue. If the US continues acting willfully, China will not hesitate fighting back at it with tougher countermeasures. The trade war is not easy for China as the major challenge would bring losses. China didnât choose a trade war but was forced to accept it. China will not surrender to the US, nor could it ignore the trade war. The only way is to face it and win it. Chinaâs development to where it is now comes from its success in grasping opportunities amid games and competitions, and this time it will win the trade war in the same way. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

On one hand, the international trade order is now directed by three major voices. France and Germany are devoted to promoting traditional rule-based free trade, which can be seen from the World Economic Forum held in Davos, Switzerland at the beginning of this year; US President Donald Trump advocates reciprocal openness-based fair trade order; and China puts great energy on advancing one that is open and inclusive. On the other hand, major developed countries are taking various approaches to speed up the launch of new topics and new rules in pursuit of establishing a system for future revolution of international trade order. In the meantime, cooperation mechanisms like the G20 and the âBRICS Plusâ are playing an active role in pushing reform of global governance. These different propositions also reveal the institutional flaws in the current international trade order. Three arduous challenges in front of world economy have yet to be addressed effectively, including the lack of growth drivers, lagging economic governance and unbalanced development. The reason for this lies in the lack of efficient and fair international trade order, reflected by the unfair distribution among developed countries, unbalanced development between developing and developed world, and weak coordination in making macroeconomic policies. The trade confrontations initiated by the US and its possible consequences constitute the biggest risk factor. By playing the tariff game with the EU, renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada, and starting a trade war against China, the US attempts to rebuild the international trade order based on its own interpretation of âfairâ trade rules as the worldâs largest economy. Big countries need to shoulder responsibility to safeguard international trade order, but the US is avoiding such obligation by slapping tariff retaliation and punishment on whoever prevents it from establishing new international trade rules. In 2017, the global economic growth maintained stable growth. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global economic growth rose from 3.2 percent in 2016 to 3.7 percent in 2017, and is expected to reach 3.9 percent in 2018 and 2019, a figure higher than the annual average of 3.74 since 1990. The growth rate of global merchandise trade is also on a rise, as data from the World Trade Organization (WTO) showed that global merchandise trade registered a growth of 1.3 percent and 4.7 percent in 2016 and 2017, and the figure for 2018 is estimated to stand at 4.4 percent. At this crucial moment, the US willfully started a global trade war, which will likely stop the growth momentum and cast shadow on global trade. For instance, the prospering manufacturing sector, especially high technology and medium- and high-tech manufacturing will lose the impetus for growth. Against the backdrop of globalization, the various procedures on an industrial chain are usually finished in different countries. A war in trade and industry may bring disorder to the global supply chain, and result in a chaotic economic, trade and industrial order that leads to an earlier recession. At this moment, major economies should think over the spillover effect the trade war may have on global economy, or else they are being irresponsible. Based on this consideration, even though the US ignited the trade war and escalated it, China remains restrained on responding to and taking countermeasures against the US and tries its best to reduce the impact of the trade war on global economy and trade. As a responsible country, China opposes trade protectionism and the beggar-thy-neighbor opportunist behavior. Meanwhile, the country continues deepening reform and opening up, pushing ahead with the construction of the Belt and Road and strengthening all-round international cooperation. Facing a global trade that might go out of order, China still looks for global cooperation with the maximum efforts. Under the new circumstance, China will continue comprehensively deepening reform of the market and expand opening up in an all-round manner to propel high-quality development. China, a country with the largest middle-income population, the largest scale of savings and the most complete industrial system, will never be marginalized. Just as it did upon the accession to the WTO, China will continue to actively take part in and propel economic globalization, dock with higher-quality markets and make its industries more globally competitive. Focusing on its own affairs, China is bound to stand in the international arena with stronger national strength and global influence. At that time, other stakeholders will be more rational on the choices of whether to work out a new set of rules to exclude China or optimize the multilateral trade rule and system together with China.

It recently threatened to slap a 25-percent tariff on $200 billion of imported Chinese goods after initially setting them at 10 percent. China, in response, announced its decision to impose additional tariffs of four different rates on 5,207 items of imported US products worth $60 billion. The countermeasures will be implemented instantly if the US puts its additional tariff measures into effect. No winner will emerge from a trade war, and an escalated tension is unexpected by all the wise brains around the world. The lose-lose trade war, in which the US âis firing shots to the entire world, including to itselfâ, has aroused ever stronger objections from the US residents and businesses. Many countries, including China, have said no to the trade bully and hegemony by taking countermeasures and filing the US to the World Trade Organization (WTO). But turning a blind eye to the interests of the whole world, the American farmers, entrepreneurs, and consumers, the US has repeatedly aggravated the tensions. China, against such backdrop, has to take necessary counteractions to protect national dignity and its people's interests, defend free trade and multilateral mechanisms, and safeguard the common interests of all countries in the world. Divergence is not a rare thing in business circle, and the disputes could be solved as long as the involved sides site down for a talk and bear each otherâs core interests in mind. China always believes that consultation based on the principles of mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit is the effective way of resolving trade differences, and any unilateral threat or blackmail will only aggravate contradictions and hurt the interests of all sides. The US who sit on its own international status and advantages to bully others will ultimately end with punishments and countermeasures. The arrogant words and dirty trick before a negotiation are a traditional tactics the US use to add its chips in the game. It repeated the story in recent days again by on one hand threatening and pressuring China with trade protectionism, and on the other hand advertising through various ways that it will restart talks with China. Such double-faced tactics will not work on China, as the latter will never swallow the bitter pill of hurting its own core interests. Expecting China to make a compromise is doomed to be the biggest strategic misjudgment for the US. What the US did will never shake Chinaâs firm resolution to safeguard its own legitimate rights and interests and protect the global economic order and economic globalization. In this war started by the US, China has been endeavoring for a solution with the greatest sincerity, by not firing the first shot or taking any radical actions to escalate the situation. Even facing with the unilateral threat and blackmail of the US, China's countermeasures with differentiated tariff rates are rational and restrained, and were proposed after extensively soliciting opinions and careful evaluation. The measures have taken into full consideration factors including the people's well-being, the bearing capacity of companies, and maintaining the functioning of the global industrial chain. But it must be clarified that China, who never surrendered to trade hegemonism in the past and will by no means do so now, has retained its rights to launch further countermeasures. The US must face up to and cherish Chinaâs efforts in solving the bilateral trade issues and get rid of compounding its mistake. Chinaâs development to where it is now in the past 40 years of reform and opening up is not easy, but the country has been more confident and stronger after each hardship. China maintained a stable economic gesture with growing momentum in the first half of this year, with the major macro-economic indicators in reasonable range and economic structure being optimized. Chinaâs vigorous and resilient economy gives it more confidence and energy to hit back the trade war in a calm manner. Facing with the new challenges and changing external environment, China can conquer all the roadblocks laying ahead, find opportunities from challenges, and hit back the provocation of trade hegemonism with high-quality development, as long as it can unswervingly deepen reforms, widen market access, and march along its own track. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

This false accusation was intended to damage China's image and reputation. More seriously, this lie confused and distorted the facts on who is the IP thief and who has stolen technologies from all over the world. The truth must be clarified through legal procedures so China has a chance to restore its reputation. There is a saying that a lie travels around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes. This is exactly the case when it comes to the US blaming China of stealing IP from the West. Those who have a basic knowledge of world economic development know that China had many innovations in history that helped the world, including Western nations, hundreds of years ago. We still remember the invaders from Western countries who came to China and stole Chinese technologies for their home countries. For instance, the techniques and knowhow of China's textile and craft industries were stolen and copied by Western companies without any payment. China in the past took the view that advanced technology belongs to and should benefit everyone. But the US, after having taken techniques from the UK, established laws to protect these stolen techniques as its own. Looking back in history, China is the real victim of IP theft. The US has tried to label China's exports as a form of economic aggression to cover up another brutal fact: the West is trying to use IP aggression to attack developing countries. The most precious human value is conscience. But unfortunately some politicians in Western countries lack that. When they talk about or look at the great progress of China, they appear narrow-minded. For example, the US used to claim China was a currency manipulator, no matter whether the US dollar depreciated or appreciated against the yuan. Whenever the US has economic problems, it blames China instead of its own policy mistakes and wrongdoings. China made every effort to maintain the value of the yuan at a stable level during the crises such as global financial crisis in 2008 to help calm the markets. If China had intentionally depreciated its currency during the crisis, the US economy could have taken another decade to recover. It was because of China's monetary policy that the global economy didn't suffer a worse setback. The US has ""framed"" China with the term of economic aggression with no evidence. There is something such as economic aggression, but it is not coming from China. It has originated in and been spread by the US. We still remember how Coca-Cola invaded the world market. It's borne in mind how the US has used cultural aggression in most countries of the world via Hollywood. Nobody can deny that the US is the largest source of economic and cultural aggression in the world. Now China has to stay vigilant against a new type of aggression - IP aggression from Western countries. IP should be a good tool for Western nations to help and support the global economy, but unfortunately some Western countries are trying to use IP as a weapon to ""enslave"" developing countries. Some have even tried to control emerging economies with it. This is an absolute betrayal of the purpose of technological advancement. Technology serves human beings. It should not be a weapon to control or stifle other nations' development. We are facing a serious problem: Developed nations have dominated IP and its advantages, and developing countries are enslaved by them forever. This is the fundamental reason that developing countries have a limited voice in world affairs and are always left behind by advanced economies. The worst part is that even when China and other developing countries produce their own IP, they are still labeled by some Western nations as thieves. This is the logic of robbers. China has produced all kinds of items for the world. Nobody has the right to call international trade ""economic aggression."" Otherwise, global trade would become global aggression, which is total nonsense. The US should stop politicizing trade and stop stigmatizing and discriminating against China and other developing countries.

The Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council on Friday unveiled lists of 5,207 items of U.S. products to be subject to additional tariffs of four different rates -- 25 percent, 20 percent, 10 percent, and 5 percent. The decision was made in response to a U.S. plan to raise tariffs to be imposed on 200 billion dollars of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent. ""China's countermeasures with differentiated tariff rates are rational and restrained, and were proposed after extensively soliciting opinions and careful evaluation,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. The measures have taken into full consideration factors including the people's well-being, the bearing capacity of companies, and maintaining the functioning of the global industrial chain, according to the spokesperson. ""China always believes that consultation based on the principles of mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit is the effective way of resolving trade differences, and any unilateral threat or blackmail will only aggravate contradictions and hurt the interests of all sides,"" the spokesperson said. The spokesperson pointed out that, because the United States had repeatedly escalated the situation in disregard of the interests of enterprises and consumers of both countries, China was forced to take the countermeasures to protect national dignity and its people's interests, defend free trade and multilateral mechanisms, and safeguard the common interests of all countries in the world. Commenting on the latest U.S. move to add some Chinese companies into its list of entities subject to U.S. export controls, the MOC said that China stands firmly against U.S. unilateral sanctions on Chinese entities. China urges the United States to relax its controls over exports to China, and protect and promote the high-tech trade and cooperation between companies from both countries, the ministry said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The rates of additional tariffs on such products will be 25 percent, 20 percent, 10 percent, and 5 percent, according to the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council. ""China was forced to take the countermeasures"" in response to a U.S. plan to raise tariffs to be imposed on 200 billion dollars of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent, the commission said in a statement. ""If the United States act willfully and puts its additional tariff measures into effect, China will instantly implement such tariff measures,"" the commission said. ""The United States violated consensuses reached by multiple bilateral negotiations and once again unilaterally escalated trade frictions,"" the commission said, noting that the move severely violated World Trade Organization rules, hurt the global industrial chain and free trade mechanism, substantially damaged the interests of China and the Chinese people, and will also have negative impacts on the economic development of the world including the United States. China has taken the countermeasures to safeguard its own legitimate rights and interests and to curb the escalation of trade frictions. Meanwhile, the measures are expected to lower the impact on the domestic production and people's lives as much as possible, it said. After implementing the countermeasures, authorities will evaluate the effects together with all sectors of society and strive to minimize the influence on production and lives, the statement said. ""China promises that it will continue to unswervingly push forward reform and opening-up based on established arrangements and pace, firmly support economic globalization, firmly safeguard free trade rules and multilateral trade mechanisms to realize joint development and share prosperity with all countries that pursue progress,"" the commission said.

On July 1, China actively reduced tariffs for daily consumer goods and automobiles involving 1,449 taxable items, with an average decrease of 55.9 percent. The price of over 70 items in a Walmart supermarket in Shenzhen have been reduced by 10 to 15 percent, including those from South Asian and European countries, Ye Shuyun, vice general manager of the supermarket disclosed. Some customers found that the price of certain products remain unchanged. One reason for this phenomenon is that some goods were imported before the tax reduction took effect, and the prices for those items imported after the move will be lowered according to the tariff adjustment, said Zeng Jun, a manager at Sfbest, an online shopping platform owned by one of Chinaâs largest couriers SF Express. The tax reduction covers all kinds of daily necessities. Among them, the average tax rate on household appliances has enjoyed the sharpest fall, from 20.5 to 8 percent. Apart from daily necessities, luxury brands are another profiteer of this tax reduction move. âOn the day that the new policy was announced, we have saved more than 700,000 yuan (about $101,872) in customs duties, which will help to reduce the final selling price,â said Zhao Shoukun, chief operating officer of COSCIA (HK) LIMITED. Zhao added that their business performance is expected to achieve a year-on-year growth of about 20 percent in the second half of this year. The tariff reduction will have a slight impact on the retail price of domestic luxury goods due to the relatively large price difference between domestic and foreign items. The domestic luxury goods market will therefore improve consumersâ shopping experience and after-sales service, which will reduce outflow of luxury consumption. In addition, after the move to reduce tariffs, imported high-end car brands have announced a price reduction of their cars in China as an effort to expand their market in the country. The price for a Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid in China has dropped by 190,000 yuan, said Zhang Peng, manager of a Porsche store in Shenzhen, adding that they obtained nearly 700 orders for the vehicle in July. Moreover, as products imported through e-commerce platforms are excluded from the tax reduction policy, some e-commerce operators are also actively making changes, for example, altering the methods of importing their products, to ensure profits. The lower tariff rate will also make it easier for more overseas goods that have not previously entered China to enter the country in a formal and general way, which will enrich the selection of commodities for consumers. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

On one hand, the international trade order is now directed by three major voices. France and Germany are devoted to promoting traditional rule-based free trade, which can be seen from the World Economic Forum held in Davos, Switzerland at the beginning of this year; US President Donald Trump advocates reciprocal openness-based fair trade order; and China puts great energy on advancing one that is open and inclusive. On the other hand, major developed countries are taking various approaches to speed up the launch of new topics and new rules in pursuit of establishing a system for future revolution of international trade order. In the meantime, cooperation mechanisms like the G20 and the âBRICS Plusâ are playing an active role in pushing reform of global governance. These different propositions also reveal the institutional flaws in the current international trade order. Three arduous challenges in front of world economy have yet to be addressed effectively, including the lack of growth drivers, lagging economic governance and unbalanced development. The reason for this lies in the lack of efficient and fair international trade order, reflected by the unfair distribution among developed countries, unbalanced development between developing and developed world, and weak coordination in making macroeconomic policies. The trade confrontations initiated by the US and its possible consequences constitute the biggest risk factor. By playing the tariff game with the EU, renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada, and starting a trade war against China, the US attempts to rebuild the international trade order based on its own interpretation of âfairâ trade rules as the worldâs largest economy. Big countries need to shoulder responsibility to safeguard international trade order, but the US is avoiding such obligation by slapping tariff retaliation and punishment on whoever prevents it from establishing new international trade rules. In 2017, the global economic growth maintained stable growth. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global economic growth rose from 3.2 percent in 2016 to 3.7 percent in 2017, and is expected to reach 3.9 percent in 2018 and 2019, a figure higher than the annual average of 3.74 since 1990. The growth rate of global merchandise trade is also on a rise, as data from the World Trade Organization (WTO) showed that global merchandise trade registered a growth of 1.3 percent and 4.7 percent in 2016 and 2017, and the figure for 2018 is estimated to stand at 4.4 percent. At this crucial moment, the US willfully started a global trade war, which will likely stop the growth momentum and cast shadow on global trade. For instance, the prospering manufacturing sector, especially high technology and medium- and high-tech manufacturing will lose the impetus for growth. Against the backdrop of globalization, the various procedures on an industrial chain are usually finished in different countries. A war in trade and industry may bring disorder to the global supply chain, and result in a chaotic economic, trade and industrial order that leads to an earlier recession. At this moment, major economies should think over the spillover effect the trade war may have on global economy, or else they are being irresponsible. Based on this consideration, even though the US ignited the trade war and escalated it, China remains restrained on responding to and taking countermeasures against the US and tries its best to reduce the impact of the trade war on global economy and trade. As a responsible country, China opposes trade protectionism and the beggar-thy-neighbor opportunist behavior. Meanwhile, the country continues deepening reform and opening up, pushing ahead with the construction of the Belt and Road and strengthening all-round international cooperation. Facing a global trade that might go out of order, China still looks for global cooperation with the maximum efforts. Under the new circumstance, China will continue comprehensively deepening reform of the market and expand opening up in an all-round manner to propel high-quality development. China, a country with the largest middle-income population, the largest scale of savings and the most complete industrial system, will never be marginalized. Just as it did upon the accession to the WTO, China will continue to actively take part in and propel economic globalization, dock with higher-quality markets and make its industries more globally competitive. Focusing on its own affairs, China is bound to stand in the international arena with stronger national strength and global influence. At that time, other stakeholders will be more rational on the choices of whether to work out a new set of rules to exclude China or optimize the multilateral trade rule and system together with China.

Ambassador Wu said that in recent years, China-Sierra Leone trade and economic relation had been flourishing and a large number of Sierra Leonean businessmen had visited China to explore business opportunities. Trade exchanges between the two have always followed the basic principles of mutual benefit and win-win cooperation, advancing the wellbeing of people of both countries.

The comments came after the United States, on one hand, threatened to raise tariffs to be imposed on 200 billion U.S. dollars worth of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent, while on the other hand, spread the news that it wants to restart negotiations with China. The U.S. act set aside the interests of its own farmers, business owners, consumers, and the interests of the world, the spokesperson said.

In the meantime, China, as always, believes in solving differences through dialogue, but that should come with the prerequisite of equal treatment and honoring commitments, the spokesperson said. The ultimate purpose of the U.S. baseless accusations against China is to suppress China's peaceful development, according to the spokesperson.

The reports say a 25 percent tariff â instead of the original 10 percent â would be proposed on $200 billion of Chinese goods by the administration of US President Donald Trump. Reports cited unnamed sources familiar with the plan, which could be announced as early as Wednesday in Washington. US pressure and blackmail on trade won't work. If the US takes further steps to escalate trade frictions, China will inevitably come up with countermeasures to resolutely protect its legitimate rights, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a news conference. Geng said China had ""always upheld using dialogue and consultations to handle trade frictions"", but talks must be based on equality and mutual respect. On July 10, the US announced a second possible round of tariff increases of 10 percent targeting $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, goods ranging from steel and aluminum products to cat food and baseball gloves. The Office of the US Trade Representative set a deadline for final public comments on the earlier proposed 10 percent tariffs to be filed by Aug 30, after public hearings scheduled for Aug 20 to 23. Sheng Liugang, an assistant professor of economics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said about 22 percent of goods subject to the additional tariff are consumer products, so levies would have a greater direct effect on US citizens. ""It violates the promises of the administration of US President Donald Trump that a trade war with China will not damage (the nation's) own people,"" he told ftchinese.com. The US is highly dependent on imports from China, especially consumer goods and industrial parts, said Liang Ming, director of the foreign trade research center at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, affiliated with the Ministry of Commerce. Among the 6,031 items on the most recent $200 billion list are 67 items on which the US depends wholly on Chinese imports, the center said. The US is dependent 90 to 100 percent on Chinese imports for 127 items. For 193 items, there is 80 to 90 percent dependence. For 207 items, there is 70 to 80 percent dependence, and for 1,150 items, there is a greater than 50 percent dependence, center officials said. ""The additional tariff on the intermediate products from China means it will cost more to produce goods for US manufacturers, and eventually it will be US consumers who pay the bill,"" he said. Wu Dongxu, general manager of the Foreign Investment Department at Beijing-based Transcontinental Management Consultancy, urged experts to analyze the Trump administration's tariff threats in a more political light. He stressed while it is economically irrational for Trump to wage a trade war, it might be politically rational to do so. Negotiations between the two nations would be long and bumpy, he warned. Wu called the US argument that China's State-owned enterprises are government-directed and not market-led ""ironic"".

The meeting is believed as great significance to accelerate integration of Latin American countries and propel them to jointly cope with prevailing trade protectionism. During the first official gathering of the two blocs, members of Pacific Alliance and the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) signed a joint declaration and approved an action plan on propelling trade facilitation and personnel exchanges, helping small- and medium-sized companies access global markets and promoting the knowledge economy. A closer cooperation between the two blocs is a strong response to rising tide of trade protectionism, said Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, adding that they will set an example for other countries by continuing their steps. President Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico, which holds the rotating presidency of the Pacific Alliance, said that with an aim to strengthen the link between the two regional blocs and advance integration among Latin American countries, the meeting is a milestone for both the Pacific Alliance and the Mercosur. He added that both sides agreed to beef up economic and trade cooperation in areas of common interests and jointly explore a new model of cooperation. The Pacific Alliance has eliminated the tariffs on 96 percent of commodities traded among its members, and plans a zero tariff for all by 2030, while the Mercosur also sets lower or zero tariffs, and free trade as its target. A collaboration between the two blocs, against such background, is a key step on their road to Latin American integration. A total of 13 summits have been held since the Pacific Alliance was established more than seven years ago, and its members have strong desire for accelerated integration and free trade, Chinaâs Ambassador to Mexico Qiu Xiaoqi told Peopleâs Daily. The participation of heads of the Mercosur members in this summit has sent a positive signal to the integrated development of Latin America, Qiu said. Trade protectionism has had a long history, and the US President Donald Trumpâs choice is especially unacceptable, said Yeidckol Polevnsky Gurwitz, President of the National Regeneration Movement, Mexicoâs next ruling party. By increasing tariffs on foreign enterprises, the US has actually raised prices of commodities and damaged the interests of consumers, she told Peopleâs Daily, calling it an âobvious mistakeâ. By shutting its door to other markets and imposing higher tariffs on imported goods, the US presents a big threat to the Pacific Alliance and will severely hinder the economic development of its member states, stressed Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal, Mexican Secretary of Economy. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera warned that if Trump aggravates tariff barriers, he will bring the global tariff system to the 1970s level. He suggested the Pacific Alliance speed up integration in wider and deeper sphere and look for international cooperation, especially with countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The Pacific Alliance, whose original goal is to strengthen Asia-Pacific trade and economic cooperation by using the membersâ geographical advantages, is now taking active measures to absorb new allies in and out of the region. Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Singapore are preparing for accession to the alliance and South Korea and Ecuador are about to launch negotiations on joining the alliance. The Pacific Alliance has over 50 observer states. China has paid close attention to the development of the alliance since 2013 when it became an observer state. The country highly values the cooperation with the Pacific Alliance, said Qiu, pledging that China will firmly uphold multilateralism and economic globalization and strongly oppose trade protectionism, unilateralism and hegemonism. Chinaâs attitude and position were agreed and appreciated by the representatives attending the summit. The Chinese market is important for alliance states, especially for Chile, according to Sergio Torretti Costa, President of the Chilean Chamber of Construction. Hailing the increasingly stronger trade ties between Chile and China, he hopes his country could export more favored goods to China, enhance two-way investment and achieve win-win results with China. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Several events during the visit deserve attention. First, the two sides set the tone for future transatlantic relations by defining them as entering the new phase, a period of closer friendship and stronger trade relations, which provides a more clear-cut strategic direction for the US and the EU. Second, the US and the EU expressed their willingness to iron out differences on trade, agreeing to the goal of working together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods, reducing barriers and increasing trade in services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products and soybeans. Third, the EU is making compromise on bilateral trade with the US in exchange for Washington's endorsement for multilateral trade system or returning to the mainstream values of the West. For instance, the EU intends to import more liquefied natural gas from the US to diversify its energy supply and lower trade barriers for US soybeans. In return, Washington agreed to work closely together with the EU to reform the WTO and to address ""unfair trading practices."" The consensus on that could be the foundation for the two sides to reach a new grand bargain on trade in the future. Fourth, both sides decided to launch new talks and mechanisms to discuss details of a possible trade deal. The Trump-Juncker meeting serves as a point of departure followed by an establishment of Executive Working Group consisting of closest advisors from both sides to carry forward the consensus. Under such mechanisms, it is possible that the two sides will lift the current tariffs against each other after talks and hold a new round of talks on an upgraded Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). The US should stop lambasting the EU on trade issues. The tariffs against the EU have already backfired. Domestic pressure is mounting on Trump as most bipartisan lawmakers believe tariffs would only drag the two economic giants into a spiral of trade restrictions and countermeasures. Trump is also facing a global wave of anti-tariff measures by Canada, Mexico and China, all of which would impose retaliatory tariffs against the US. To step back from a larger trade war with the EU would ensure that the US is not to be isolated by all its trading partners. However, it is still too early to conclude that transatlantic relations will be back to the right track. The two sides have not reached a deal on how to roll back current tariffs. A significant omission during the meeting has been the Iran nuclear deal. The joint statement did not mention the Iran issue and both sides did not come up with plans to solve the differences. If the US imposes secondary sanctions on EU enterprises due to their business connections with Iran, it will definitely break the spirit of the joint statement and create more troubles for transatlantic relations. Despite the de-escalation of the US-EU trade row, transatlantic ties seem to be drifting toward an uncertain future. It certainly is a product of Trump's policies but also following the historical trend since the end of the Cold War. What had united Europe and the US has lost strength these years, be it ties in security, economy or shared values. NATO, the most important institution binding the US and Europe together, is under pressure not only from Trump. Transatlantic economic links, though still extremely close, are facing challenges to explore growth areas when reviving the TTIP or a less ambitious mini-TTIP is far from easy. The EU, which particularly relies on exports, is dependent on other important economic centers around the world. In terms of shared values, the US under Trump is less interested in it and the EU, considering its own situation in the age of rising populism and illiberal tendencies inside its own borders, has become increasingly lonely. More importantly, the US and the EU look increasingly different now in terms of their basic views about the world we live in and the role they should play. The Trump administration's National Security Strategy depicts a dangerous world where the US, which still boasts of immense power, should fight single-handedly with those revisionist powers. On the contrary, the EU in its first Global Strategy which was adopted in June, 2016 sees a world where both challenges and opportunities abound and Brussels could succeed using its considerable soft power and its success formula - multilateralism. These underlying differences between the US and the EU have been the sources of many intense moments between the two and will become more obvious during Trump's era. In a nutshell, though the joint statement of the EU and the US is comforting to many in the West in the sense of averting an imminent trade collision between the two, it is certainly not the end of the story. Trump's unpredictability cannot be underestimated and the foundation of the transatlantic partnership has already been eroded.

As the White House threatens to impose higher duties on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, US port managers are bracing for the prospect of canceled shipments and lost jobs after possible countermeasures to be taken by the Chinese government, a CNBC report said on July 29. Statistics from the 328 official ports of entry maintained by US Customs and Border Protection indicated that, more than $505 billion worth of goods arrived from China last year. Southern California ports handled $173 billion in Chinese imports last year, about a third of all goods shipped from China to the US. Los Angeles/Long Beach Seaport, the Port of Chicago and the Port of New York are the largest three ports in handling Chinese imports, said US port management department. They respectively accepted $79 billion, $23 billion and $20 billion of Chinese goods in the first five months this year. According to Descartes, a global leader in uniting logistics-intensive businesses, the Port of Los Angeles has handled a total of $250.3 billion worth of goods by the end of 2017, 61 percent of which came from the trade with China. The ratio was 31 percent in the Port of New York which loaded and unloaded $165.26 billion of products. Statistics showed that the China-related business accounted for over a quarter of the total trade volume for 16 out of the 20 largest ports in the US. The CNBC report analyzed that the Trump administrationâs tariff policy against China will place a comprehensive impact on major US ports. The west coast ports, especially the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are on the front lines of the trade war. According to the annual financial report issued by the port of Los Angeles this April, these two ports have provided 190,000 jobs by the end of 2017. Besides, they have indirectly created 992,000 jobs for the Southern California and 2.8 million for the entire US. ""It would be a game-changer,"" said the executive director of the Port of Long Beach. ""It would be detrimental to jobs at the port and detrimental to the state and national economy."" He introduced that last year, trade with China accounted for $145 billion in imports and exports, over half of the Los Angeles ports' total. So any slowdown in China trade flow could bring layoffs, he added. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach handle roughly 40 percent of US imports, and trade through the complex supports hundreds of thousands of jobs throughout the region, said the Los Angeles Times, adding that the escalation of the trade war may soon hit the warehouse workers and truck drivers in Southern California and bring on a rise in price for the consumers. Last year, $173 billion in Chinese imports flowed through Southern California ports, said Jock OâConnell, an economist with Beacon Economics, elaborating that the largest categories of goods included electronics, furniture, toys and clothing. He added that its exports to China totaled $18 billion, consisting of auto parts, cotton, scrap material and more. The resulting price increase probably will force companies to purchase fewer Chinese products, said Paul Bingham, a trade expert with Economic Development Research Group, predicting that it will lead to a slowdown in trade and fewer hours for port-related workers. âLongshore workers, with strong union protections, will fare better than most workers. But many truck drivers and warehouse workers are independent contractors or employed by third-party temporary help agencies and are especially vulnerable to a drop-off in trade,â the Los Angeles Times predicted. A report issued by the Washington-based Brookings Institution this May revealed that Los Angeles rubber plants, Napa Valley wineries, as well as vegetable, fruit and berry farms in the Central Valley will be the first to be impacted in the trade war initiated by the Trump administration against China. A total of 287,000 jobs in California are in businesses targeted by Chinese tariffs, 156,000 in Texas, and 154,000 in the State of Washington. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The trade war has severely damaged the rule-based multilateral trading system. On July 26, the country further escalated the tensions at the third meeting of the WTO General Council of 2018. A US representative deliberately tarnished Chinaâs economic model, trying to find excuses for his countryâs unilateral actions by such defaming. His remarks were solemnly refuted by the Chinese side. Rather than taking introspection on its own behaviors, the US is even denying the facts and defaming China. Such ridiculous frauds will only end up being exposed. Chinaâs endeavors speak for itself and are recognized by the international society. In the recent white paper titled âChina and the World Trade Organization (WTO)â, the Chinese government proves to the world that the country has fulfilled its promises made at the accession to the organization, and will do more to further open the market with accurate statistics. Chinaâs efforts to honor commitment and courage to shoulder responsibilities have won it world-wide reputation. â(WTO) members highlighted the importance of China's contribution to global growth over recent years,"" said Eloi Laourou, chairperson of the WTO's trade policy review (TPR) body at the seventh TPR on China in mid July, adding that members generally expressed appreciation for China's active role in the body. His remarks represent a fair evaluation from the international community. The provocation of the US at the meeting of the WTO General Council aimed at nothing but hiding its true intention to infringe upon the multilateral trading system. The so-called âfair tradeâ grounded on âAmerica firstâ philosophy indeed goes against the rule-based multilateral trading system, and tramples on the face of the international trade rules, as its final goal is to seek preferential trade conditions through pressuring and bargains. Facing a China that stands firm against its blackmail, the US side started resorting to international organizations. It is fantasizing that China will finally compromise as long as it makes louder voices and keeps undermining the confidence of the international society in Chinaâs development. However, such move will not place any impact on China. China has reiterated on many occasions that it will resolutely protect the core national interests and interests of its people. What is pathetic about some US officials is that they only stay in the comfort zone and fail to see the trend of the world. Every country has the right to select the most appropriate way of development. The energetic path of socialism with Chinese characteristics has scored remarkable achievements and created huge opportunities for the world, which is also well recognized by the people from both China and the world. It cannot be denied just by a few ridiculous words of the US. The facts have given a heavy blow to the US. When some Western countries are trapped in system crisis, China is having a great time seeking for high-quality development. The Chinese way of development is being more and more accepted with increasing attraction. The conclusion reached by the US representative that âChinaâs economic model has proven to be particularly trade disruptiveâ is nothing but a joke. WTO statistics showed that China's imports accounted for 10.2 percent of the world total merchandise import in 2017, and its exports 12.8 percent, making China a major trade partner of more than 120 countries and regions. If Chinaâs economic model was âtrade disruptiveâ, how did the country rose to such a vital status in todayâs global trade? A total of 74 percent of US enterprises and 55 percent of EU companies decided to expand their investment in China this year, up 5 and 4 percent respectively from a year ago. If Chinaâs economic model was âtrade disruptiveâ, why did the majority of 20,000-plus US companies operating in China choose to inject more capital in the country? WTO Director-General Roberto AzevÃªdo recently gave his answer to who is hurting the global trade. He said the US tariff raise has further deteriorated global trade relations, which would pose serious threats to the global economic growth. Based on incomplete figures, the White House has ordered an estimated 94 investigations into so-called âunfair trade practicesâ involving dozens of countries in slightly over a year, a year-on-year increase of 81 percent. By opposing the new appointments to WTO appeals body, the US has broken the smooth operation of the dispute settlement mechanism and endangered the multilateral trading system. It is urgent for WTO members to join hands in opposing protectionism and fight back the US protectionism such as the Section 232 and Section 301 investigations, in a bid to bring back the orders to global trade. US political analyst Andre Vltchek once said that the more China does for the world, the less aggressively it behaves, the more it will be hated and demonized in the West. It is precisely because China is, unlike the West, trying to improve the lives of the entire planet Earth, that the plundering and bullying practices of some countries against world are contained. Obviously, this point has been well proven by the groundless accusations of the US against China in recent days. A clean hand wants no washing. The groundless defaming of the US to divert attention of the international society and the countryâs unilateral initiation of the trade war are of no justice or morality, and will only be widely objected by the international community. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"
121,http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2018/0801/c90000-9486702.html,Editorial: Where the trade war goes is up to US,"August 01, 2018","More than 20 days have passed since Washington unilaterally started a trade war against China on July 6, during which both sides have exchanged tariffs on $34 billion worth of commodities from each other. It still needs more evaluation to see gains and loss of each side in the first round of confrontation. But it is obvious that China did not surrender when facing the bullying practices of Washington, and demonstrated its resolution to continue fighting under high pressure. As planned, August is the time for the White House to determine whether to slap tariffs on another $16 billion worth of Chinese imports, and it will also decide whether to impose an additional 10-percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods in late August. The choices to be made by the US will decide where the US-China trade war will go: alleviation or escalation. Though China has prepared for the worst, the âballâ is controlled by the US. But Washington turned a blind eye to the facts, claiming that âthe ball is in China's courtâ. If comparing the trade war to a soccer match, the US tariff policies on Chinese imports are flagrant kicks at the players on the opposing team rather than the ball, and the US trade protectionism is equivalently a handball inside the penalty area. Both violations deserve a red card and the players who commit them should be sent off the court. However, the US has even driven off the referee and acted like one itself. What the US has damaged is not only the match, but also the whole game. Washington did send signals for times of âbeing always prepared to negotiateâ during the trade war. But its true intention is to escape responsibilities and kick the ball to the Chinese court. As the trade blackmail of the US has been condemned unanimously by the international community, doing so could ease the external pressure on its arbitrary acts. Moreover, the US did so to appease domestic critics. The White House will face with a daunting task to deal with the louder oppositions from more American residents, enterprises and industries, whose interests will be severely threatened by the escalation of the trade war. Some scholars regard it as an indication of Washingtonâs diffident conscience, in a belief the US has lost the confidence to win the trade war after realizing its underestimation of Chinaâs resolution and strength. By saying so, the White House is actually making public opinion preparation to get itself ride of historical responsibilities. Although the point cannot be easily verified, it can reflect Washingtonâs attitudes from the side. As a matter of fact, Washington has been playing the cards of both âthe actions of banditsâ and âthe logic of roguesâ from the very beginning. It performed the bandit action by unilaterally imposing heavy tariffs on Chinese imports, while trying to rationalize and justify such action with the âlogic of rogues.â The US always swears black as white, and such tactics works due to its overwhelming right of speech in the international community. This time Washington still deceived many people with its artificial argument, even including some Chinese, despite the least support it received in history. However, fact cannot be changed by artificial argument. Before July 6, China and the US have gone through several rounds of negotiations and reached consensus, but the latter tore up the agreement when the international community were expecting a truce. The US, going back on its word, finally ignited the trade war against China, and escalated the tension recklessly. Throughout the process, China has been sincerely seeking a path to solve the problem, while the US failed to keep faith and became insatiable. As a result, thereâs no necessity to continue trade negotiations as the US side had destroyed its credibility in the Chinese society. Whether or not Washington will play its trump card in the coming August, China will give its response accordingly. But it is the US who will be entangled in how to play the game. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

As an warm-up event for the upcoming China International Import Expo (CIIE), the 2018 Belt and Road Brand Expo kicks off in Shanghai on Friday, June 30, 2018.[Photo: VCG] Experts said that the launch of the CIIE not only shows China's determination to open up at a time when global protectionism casts a shadow on international trade, but points to China's policy change from overreliance upon exports to embracing a more balanced trade structure. Companies from over 130 countries and regions from five continents have confirmed participation in the upcoming CIIE, Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Bingnan told the press conference. Participants include businesses from developing, developed and least-developed countries, he said. Wang also said more than 200 businesses attending the CIIE are on the Fortune Global 500 list of industrial leaders. The exhibitors are expected to bring along more new products and technologies to the CIIE, revealing their cutting-edge products. The first CIIE will consist of three sessions - the enterprise and business exhibition, which will display overseas products, the country pavilion for trade and investment, which will offer trade goods and services, and the Hongqiao International Trade Forum. Several overseas exhibitors revealed their plans for the CIIE at another press conference on Thursday. Jaguar Land Rover will launch a luxury electric SUV, while Japan-based shopping mall Takashimaya Company is going to display some traditional Japanese fashions. Shift of trade policy The launch of the CIIE comes up at a time when the world is shrouded in a shadow of trade protectionism, particularly the US initiated tariff increases against China. Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute at Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Friday that the CIIE shows a kind of shift in China's trade policy. According to Dong, China used to be overly reliant on exports, as previous trade expos in China mainly exhibited Chinese exports. ""In the past, China emphasized exports in order to guarantee foreign currency reserves. But now that forex reserves are sufficient, the government is trying to embrace a trade structure that is more balanced, meaning that imports should also develop fast,"" Dong said. Customs data released on July 13 show that China's exports surged 12.8 percent on a yearly basis to $1.17 trillion while imports rose 19.9 percent year-on-year to $1.03 trillion in the first six months of this year. Dong said the government wants the CIIE to introduce quality goods made by overseas countries to domestic consumers. Cong Yi, an economics professor at the Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times that the CIIE shows China's determination to promote a more open trade environment, and shows China's efforts in restoring the international trade balance. ""It shows that China is not moving toward isolation, but toward opening-up,"" Cong told the Global Times on Friday. Dong said that as the trade dispute between China and the US continues, another goal of the CIIE is to help Chinese companies find potential trade partners that can replace US companies in case the dispute deteriorates further. This doesn't mean US companies are not welcome to the CIIE. ""As long as there are benefits (to US companies), they will come voluntarily,"" Bai Ming, deputy director of the International Market Research Institute under the Ministry of Commerce, told the Global Times on Friday. Bai said that he personally hopes to see companies from the services sector, such as tourism, finance and healthcare at the CIIE, because European and US companies are relatively strong in those areas. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The Trump administration announced recently that it would provide up to $12 billion in emergency relief for farmers hurt by the ongoing trade friction with China, but Bloomberg cited Neal Bredehoeft, a corn and soybean farmer in Missouri, as saying Thursday that what US famers want is a quick return to free trade, rather than handouts from the US government. As trade tensions continue, however, the farmers' wish won't come true. It's possible that the trade conflict will evolve into a prolonged trade war, in which Chinese companies will have to draw up long-term plans to diversify their import sources. If trade tension between China and the US lasts longer than one planting season, the planting areas for corn and soybeans in Brazil and other countries are likely to increase in a bid to fill the gap in the Chinese market left by US agricultural products. US farm produce is facing increasing competition in the Chinese market. There is no doubt a 25 percent additional tariff on a range of US farm produce will deal a fatal blow to China's imports of those items. New distribution channels set up by Chinese importers that switch to new suppliers in other countries, and Chinese consumers' acceptance of the new farm products, will perhaps drive US farm produce out of the Chinese market. China is one of the world's largest importers of agricultural goods. In 2017, the nation imported $24 billion worth of US farm produce, including more than 32.9 million tons of soybeans, accounting for 34.4 percent of China's total imports of that crop. The question is whether US farmers are able to afford to lose such a huge market forever. A wider range of US products risk losing their largest consumers in China. China doesn't want a trade war, but Washington may be playing a long game, so Chinese companies have to find alternative import sources other than the US. With a growing army of middle-class consumers, China is one of the world's most promising markets for business opportunities, but US sellers may miss the chance to meet China's increasing demand in the global markets. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Ambassador Zhang Ming, head of the Chinese mission to the European Union, in the article titled ""China Firmly Supports and Upholds The Multilateral Trading System"", gave a rundown on what China has done to this end. ACCESSION COMMITMENTS FULFILLED After its accession to the WTO, China significantly lowered import tariff rates and non-tariff barriers, liberalized the right to trade, boosted the services sector and reduced restrictions on foreign investment, he wrote. Citing official data, he noted that China has reviewed and revised 2,300 laws, regulations and departmental rules at the central government level, and 190,000 policies and regulations at sub-central government levels By 2010, China had fulfilled all of its tariff reduction commitments, reducing the average tariff level from 15.3 percent in 2001 to 9.8 percent, he underlined. Meanwhile, China has built an Intellectual Property Right (IPR) legal system that conforms to WTO rules and suits its national conditions. Since 2001, intellectual property royalties paid by China to foreign right holders has registered an annual growth of 17 percent, reaching 28.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2017, he wrote. FREE TRADE UPHOLDER Since joining the WTO, China has played an active role in liberalizing and facilitating trade and investment and firmly upheld the authority and efficacy of the multilateral trading system, he wrote. China explicitly opposes unilateralism and trade protectionism, he underscored, adding that China supports the independent and impartial role of the WTO Appellate Body. With a view to better safeguarding free trade and adapting to the changing tides of global economy and trade, China and the EU are actively engaged in communication and coordination on the modernization of the WTO, he wrote. LIVING UP TO RESPONSIBILITY As a major power, China is willing to provide more public goods to the international community, he wrote. Since the Belt and Road Initiative was proposed in 2013, more than 80 countries and international organizations have signed cooperation agreements with China, he noted. From 2013 to 2017, the total value of China's trade with other Belt and Road countries exceeded 5 trillion U.S. dollars, and total investment by Chinese enterprises in these countries exceeded 70 billion U.S.dollars, he wrote. By the end of 2017, Chinese enterprises had set up 75 overseas economic and trade cooperation zones in relevant countries, and created 220,000 local jobs, he added. FIRM STEPS TO EXPAND OPENING-UP Fulfilling China's WTO commitments has never been the end point of its opening-up, he wrote, underlining that China commits itself to opening up even wider and deeper. In recent years, China has self-initiated significant reductions to import tariffs for multiple times, he noted. According to the WTO, China's trade-weighted average import tariff rate had fallen to 4.4 percent in 2015, only 1.5 to 2 percentage points higher than those of developed economies such as the United States and the EU. In the meantime, China has witnessed an impressive improvement in terms of trade facilitation. The average time for customs clearance has been reduced to less than 20 hours for imports, he wrote. By March 2018, all items for non-administrative license approval had been canceled. In the first half of 2018, revision of the negative list for foreign investment was completed, substantially widening market access for foreign investment in the financial sector, among others, he added, ""China, as it opens wider to the world among efforts to pursue high-quality growth, is bound to contribute significantly to the stability of the world economy and the wellbeing of people of all countries in the world,"" he wrote. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"
125,http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2018/0727/c90000-9485305.html,Implications of EU-US trade truce for China,"July 27, 2018","European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and US President Donald Trump reached a compromise Wednesday to resolve their trade conflicts. The EU pledged to expand imports of soybeans and liquefied natural gas from the US. Washington agreed to hold off on US tariffs on cars and auto parts from the EU. The two sides also said they would seek to eliminate tariffs, trade barriers and subsidies for non-automotive industrial goods. Wednesday's compromise between Washington and Brussels greatly eased trade tension between the two sides, but did not completely solve their problems. It will be a huge challenge to realize zero tariffs between the two. Consensus will be hard to reach within the EU and Trump will likely break his word again. Yet the possibility exists that the two will turn their compromise into serious negotiations and a final agreement. At least there is the likelihood the US will slow its conflicts with Europe and focus on countering China. Against this backdrop, analyses from the following perspectives are necessary. Has China ever expected Beijing and Brussels to jointly fight the US? Beijing was willing to see the EU opposing US unilateralism, but it did not think China and the EU could become allies against Washington in the trade war. Nor did Beijing count on Brussels to help China in reducing tariff pressure from the US. Both the US and Europe are developed societies, with a similar level of industrial and technological capabilities. They are also more or less of equal strength in dealing with tariff disputes. China is a developing country, which was the legal identity of China in its accession to the WTO. China has a huge GDP, but given its supersized social scale, uneven development and relatively backward development of production in most areas, it is unfair to ask China to assume the full responsibilities of a developed country. Trump's core requirement is that Beijing and Washington must trade with each other under the exact same conditions. This is like making a middleweight boxer fight a heavyweight: China will be at a disadvantage. The EU and Japan recently announced the establishment an open trade zone and that Brussels will abolish tariffs on 99 percent of imports from Japan. If the US and the EU can go toward the same direction, a zero-tariff trade zone will be gradually formed among developed economies. In that case, China will be forced to reduce its import duties. Beijing would find it hard to expand its trade ties with other nations. From the perspective of resolving trade disputes, the further opening-up of China is actually a move made by Beijing to keep itself closer to the trade standards of developed nations. China is moving forward. A series of opening-up measures announced during the 2018 Boao Forum for Asia covered all major areas. But there are indeed certain areas that China cannot realize for now. No matter how much pressure Washington puts on Beijing, it will not give in. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The comment was made after a two-day public hearing by the Office of the US Trade Representative was wrapped up in Washington proposing tariffs on another $16 billion worth of Chinese exports. In hundreds of comments sent by business associations to the US trade authority office, more than 90 percent opposed the newly proposed tariffs, said Gao Feng, the ministry's spokesman. ""Since the US conducted a Section 301 investigation, the US has been intensifying trade frictions while blaming China for the negotiations being at a standstill,"" Gao said. Section 301 deals with intellectual property rights issues. The two countries have not yet been in touch regarding a possible timetable for a resumption of negotiations, Gao said. ""China has said many times that it is never eager to take part in a trade war, but it is not afraid to participate if necessary. China will firmly defend its legitimate rights,"" he said, adding that the country will enhance cooperation with its global trading partners and firmly defend free trade principles and a multilateral trade mechanism. The US trade authority also identified an additional $200 billion in goods slated for a 10 percent duty hike after China recently retaliated amid the escalating trade dispute. US President Donald Trump has said he is ""ready to go"" with tariffs on $500 billion in imports. Gao said the US, for domestic political agenda purposes, would rather sabotage the current hard-earned global trade system as well as damage the rights and interests of companies along the entire value chain, including the US agricultural sector. ""But such blackmailing and threats will not have any impact on China,"" he stressed. Of the tariffs targeting $50 billion in Chinese goods, $34 billion worth took effect on July 6, and the remainder depends on the outcome of the two-day US Trade Representative hearing, which concluded on Wednesday. ""The proposed action is not in the interests of the United States,"" the China Chamber of Commerce said. ""Raising tariffs will not only hurt US importers, retailers and downstream industries, but also result in a higher cost of living for ordinary Americans and put millions of US jobs that are tied to trade with China at risk."" Semiconductors are the fourth-largest US export by revenue, with a trade surplus of over $6 billion in 2017, and the US has consistently had a semiconductor trade surplus with China, with a surplus of approximately $2 billion in 2017, according to the US International Trade Commission. On the import side, many Chinese-made semiconductors coming into the US are designed and/or manufactured in the US and shipped to China for the final stage of assembly, testing and packaging, the Semiconductor Industry Association said. ""Tariffs on US semiconductor-related imports from China would cause US companies to pay tariffs on their own products,"" the association said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

File photo: VCG The US $12 billion agricultural aid program to support its farmers will not be sustainable, experts said, and US farmers will ultimately lose out in the ongoing trade tension between China and the US, with the entire supply chain being disrupted. Aiming to remedy US farmers' losses, the US government announced on Tuesday that it would provide $12 billion to support the agricultural sector, including direct payments to hog farms, according to Reuters. ""This is a really ironic action. The US has long criticized China's industrial subsidies and now the US is doing it,"" a Chinese expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Global Times, adding that US President Donald Trump took the decision mainly for political purposes ahead of midterm elections. But ""the move is not sustainable,"" Li Yuanlong, a hog farmer in Xingtai, North China's Hebei Province, who has about 10,000 pigs, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Li noted that the US government is basically trying to help its farmers at the same time as hurting them with the trade war. Ma Wenfeng, a senior analyst at Beijing Orient Agribusiness Consultancy, said that US farmers have been hurt not just by the tariffs but by disruptions to their supply chain, and temporary relief efforts won't fix the situation. ""It is more than just the tariffs. The trade dispute also disrupts the procedures for importing and exporting, which could have an even bigger impact than the tariffs,"" Ma said. ""It is hard to say that Chinese farmers will definitely benefit from this, but US farmers will definitely lose out,"" Ma told the Global Times. As part of a broader response to punitive US tariffs on Chinese goods, China has slapped a 25 percent tariff on US pork imports, which has offered some respite for Chinese hog farmers who have been hit by low pork prices since Spring Festival in February. Zero exports ""After losing about 200 yuan ($29.6) on each pig since Spring Festival because of extremely low prices, we can now break even,"" Li said. ""It is not ideal but it is certainly a relief."" According to Li, just last week, pork prices increased to about 6 yuan per 500 grams from around 5 yuan before. While other seasonal factors may have influenced prices, including oversupply in a low-demand period following Spring Festival, the tariffs on US pork imports ""definitely had something to do with the increase,"" he said. Meanwhile, US pork exports to China dropped by 9 percent from the beginning of the year to 60,265 tons at the end of May, according to data from the US Meat Export Federation. And in recent weeks, the US Agricultural Department has reported ""zero"" weekly pork exports to China. The exports have ""pretty much collapsed,"" National Public Radio quoted Mary Lovely, an economist at Syracuse University, as saying. Ma Changshou, who runs a large hog farm in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Southwest China's Sichuan Province, told the Global Times that he does not know exactly how the trade dispute is affecting his business. But, ""if the cost of US pork in the Chinese market increases, then it loses its competitive edge and that's good for us."" var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

As one of the busiest port for vehicle imports in southern China, Xinsha has set a new record of customs declaration of nearly 15,000 vehicles on a single day this month. ""We have taken new measures to speed up customs clearance,"" said Wei Xiangyu, an official with Xinsha Customs. The major driver behind the surge is China's reduction of automobile tariffs since July. China imports over 1 million vehicles a year and the tariff slashing was estimated to be a bonus package of 45 billion yuan (6.6 billion U.S. dollars) for Chinese customers. ""The tariff cut is a concrete impetus to the market,"" said Xiao Yaofei, a professor with Guangdong University of Foreign Studies. In addition, China has slashed tariffs on 1,500 types of consumer goods and exempted duties on 28 types of drugs this year. China's imports of goods grew 11.5 percent in the January-June period, compared with 4.6 percent growth for exports, according to the General Administration of Customs. The stronger import growth is an encouraging sign for a global market in the shadow of protectionism. ""Expanding imports can boost domestic demand and exports of quality products and services of other countries,"" said Gu Xueming, head of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation. ""What's more, China's move has sent a more positive signal for the global economy as it can serve as a hedge against the anti-globalization force,"" said Gu. China's domestic consumption is in transition with growing purchasing power of consumers, and the measures to boost imports would benefit both small and large countries and businesses. Xu Bing, spokesman of Canton Fair and deputy director of China Foreign Trade Center, said food and consumer goods from over 100 countries and regions have taken center stage of the international pavilion at the country's largest trade fair. ""Not only developed countries and multinational companies, but also developing countries and small- and medium-sized businesses benefit from China's imports,"" said Xu. Li Kaiyi, an official with the Guangdong Sub-Administration of China Customs, said Guangdong has seen fast growth in imports of various goods in the first half of the year: 26 percent growth for fruits, 79 percent growth for aquatic products and 200 percent growth for cosmetics. ""As more Chinese experience consumption upgrading, China's measures to expand imports of quality products could help them meet demands for a better life,"" said Li. One of Chile's largest fruit growers and exporters, Gesex has seen rising sales to China over the past years. Gonzalo Matamala, president of Gesex China, said he expected more fruit to be brought to Chinese consumers' tables following big-selling cherries and nectarines. Dealers can apply for customs declaration before the fruit arrives and quick customs clearance helps more fresh fruits reach customers. Guangdong has seen cherry imports up 170 percent so far this year. More direct flights, faster customs clearance and improved cold chain logistics have made it possible to bring eels, crabs and shrimps from Bangladesh and Egypt to the tables of Chinese diners, said Xu Zhenhan, secretary general of Shenzhen Association of Aquatic Animals and Products Importers and Exporters. ""The prices are reasonable and customers can afford them,"" said Xu. In the short term, the tariff cuts could hurt China's garment industry, particularly the high-end brands, said Zhou Lun, executive vice president of Guangdong Association of Garment and Garment Article Industry. But in the long run, the consumption upgrading could help upgrade the whole industrial chain, said Zhou. ""Meanwhile, expanding imports could help optimize the supply chain and promote intelligent manufacturing and thus push Chinese firms to churn out better products for both domestic and overseas markets,"" Zhou added. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The weekend event is also the first G20 financial meeting since China and the US exchanged tariffs on $34 billion of each otherâs goods. Mnuchin will hold separate bilateral meetings with officials from France, Canada, Germany and Mexico, among others, the South China Morning Post reported, adding that G7 officials on hand for the broader meeting would also hold an one-hour session during which they would again discuss âconcrete action with regard to China and its economic aggressionâ. The Reuters report is not optimistic about the US plan, holding that such efforts will be complicated by frustration over US steel and aluminum import tariffs on the EU and Canada who have responded with retaliatory tariffs. The conclusion has been agreed by Eswar Prasad, former head of the International Monetary Fund's China Division, who said that ""(US) hostile actions against long-standing trading partners and allies has weakened its economic and geopolitical influence."" âI have noted that many US citizens and its allies have spoken out unreservedly. The US is now the biggest wrecking ball to world stability and certainty. Its unilateralism and protectionism pose the greatest threat to the international rules and the world economic order,â Hua stressed at a briefing, responding to a ridiculous claim by a senior US official. Peter Navarro, Director of the US National Trade Council, claimed previously that China is in a ""zero-sum game"" with the rest of the world when it comes to trade, and âwhat the US needs to do is to work with the rest of the world to deal with it.â âThe retail price for Apple's iPhone 7 starts at $649, but manufacturers in China only get less than 1% of the value. When China exports a $450 worth of business suit to the US, China gets 5% of the profit while the US gets 84%,â Hua refuted his words with facts. âI am curious how the US side would like to explain these figures. Do they also want to cite these figures to prove that the US is shortchanged in its trade deals with China and China is playing the zero-sum game here with the US?â she asked. âEveryone is watching when the US side behaves like this in international relations, and everyone is hearing and seeing what the US officials are saying and doing.

The EU is ready for retaliation if US President Donald Trump puts tariffs on imported automobiles and auto parts, its trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom warned on Thursday at a press conference, stressing that the EU has no other choices but to react though it does not want an escalation of the conflicts.

A New York Times comment said that the EU is getting closer to China and Japan to buttress a global system as Europe and other parts of the world have accepted that Trump and his mission of disruption are not going away, after months of denial, anger, bargaining and depression. Financial Times, in a commentary, called on the whole world to âjoin battle in Trump's trade war Premiumâ as the best reaction against âAmerica Firstâ is to leave America behind.

The bill was previously strongly resisted by some lawmakers and big companies out of their worries that the overseas investment will face excessive restrictions. The US administrationâs âAmerica Firstâ policy did not win it expected supports.

Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson said he will send economic official to China out of concerns that the US tariff may hurt the economy of his state, while pointing out that retaliatory measures from Canada and Mexico worry him more. The latest survey made by Pew Research Center revealed that more Americans see negative than positive impact for the US tariff against China, the EU and other trading partners.

He also said that it is China that does not want to make a deal and is holding things up, adding that he thinks the ball is in Chinaâs court. Commerce Ministry spokesperson Gao Feng said at a press briefing on Thursday that US unreliability and failure to keep its word are why the door for bilateral negotiations is shut. âVarious US officials claimed that China is responsible for the collapse in negotiations. This is not consistent with the facts,â Gao said, pointing to several rounds of talks between Chinese and American officials that at one point even led to an agreement to avert a trade war. âRight in front of everyoneâs eyes, the US went back and forth and ate its own words, and the US official still dared to call white black and tried to shift the blame onto China. That honestly entails some extraordinary imagination and is just preposterously shocking,â Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a regular press conference on July 19. Hua pointed out that China has been sincere and patient enough to seek a settlement of the disputes through dialogue and consultation, and has done its utmost to avoid an escalation of the trade friction. âRight is right, and wrong is wrong,â Hua emphasized. âWhat the US did once again chips away at its own credibility and will not help solve the issue in any way.â Hua emphasized that Chinaâs position and attitude on the trade issue with the US is consistent and clear. âFrom the very beginning, we made clear our firm position of not wanting to fight but never afraid of fighting. The US, however, holding high its baton, has been rudely threatening and coercing China, and brazenly engaging in flip-flopping and backpedaling, which is the direct and root cause for the escalation of the situation.â âThe US should keep in mind that today is the 21st century with a high level of economic globalization, and it is China they are dealing with.â Hua added. âThose in the US should drag themselves out of their quixotic fantasy and stop acting as if they were the Don Quixote of the 17th century.â Kudlow claimed on Wednesday that America is the lowest-tariff country in the world among the major countries. âOur average tariff, I think, is about 2.5 percent. Now, Chinaâs average tariff is about 14 percent. It was worse, but they havenât made any progress lately. By the way, Europeâs is also rising,â said Kudlow. Yet his remarks were refuted immediately in a report entitled âKudlow Overstates American, Chinese and European Tariffsâ by The New York Times on the same day, saying his claim is exaggerated. âMr. Kudlow was seeking to justify Mr. Trumpâs trade dispute with China and the European Union with a dramatic â but overstated â comparison of tariffs that each impose,â according to the report. It noted that âeven among major economies, the US does not have the lowest tariffs in the world, though they are among the lowest.â According to the 2018 Economic Report of the President released by the White House in early 2018, Australiaâs and Japanâs tariffs were even lower. The report pointed out that the 14 percent figure that Kudlow cited for Chinese tariffs is close to the percent that Beijing imposes, on average, on agricultural products. Separately, the World Bank estimated that China imposed an average tariff of 7.9 percent, a weighted average of 3.5 percent against all goods. The report said that for Kudlowâs claims about trade barriers imposed by China and the EU to be accurate, he would need to selectively apply different metrics in each case. Updated figures for 2018 would almost certainly show a rise in US tariff rates, because the Trump administration has imposed new tariffs on a variety of imported products this year, according to The New York Times. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The White House fired the first shot of the largest trade war the world has ever seen by levying 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese products starting from July 6. Five days later, Washington worsened the tensions by threatening to slap an additional 10-percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. The US, as the instigator of a trade fight between the largest two economies of the world, is doomed to swallow the bitter fruits at last. The trade war is unquestionably a damage to the reputation of the US. China and the US had reached consensus on not starting a trade war after four rounds of tough negotiation. But the US soon ate its words and turned hostile. Thereâs an old Chinese saying that a person without credibility would fall, a nation without credibility would collapse. Being a major country that throws credibility away, the US has disheartened other countries when making a contact. In addition, the trade war hurts the US economy. The US consumers would finally pay for the trade war because those added tariffs on Chinese products will be finally transferred to them as a result of the high economic integration between the two countries. Statistics indicated that the consumer price index of the US would be 1 percentage points higher if the White House keeps amplifying the tariffs. The US enterprises operating in China would face severe challenges as well. Over $20 billion of the products on the $34 billion tariff list are produced by overseas companies in China, of which the US ones take a considerable ratio. In this sense, the trade war is nothing but a slap on the face of these US companies. Moreover, many of the US citizens would suffer from unemployment due to the trade war. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, warned that the tariff policies released so far are expected to cost the US 145,000 jobs by the end of 2019, and this figure would further expand to 500,000 if the US administration increases tariffs on an extra $100 billion of Chinese products. Whatâs worse, the US would miss chance in the broad Chinese market. With the worldâs largest middle-income population, China remains the largest auto market, outbound tourists resource, and the second largest medical, drug and box office markets. The trade war initiated by the US against China is shutting down the door to the Chinese market for many American products. Besides, the trade war leads to a tarnished international image of the US. Claiming the world is taking advantages of the US, the White House is turning the âAmerica firstâ to âAmerica onlyâ. It might help the country gain short-term profits, but such practice also exposes the countryâs selfishness. The US not only points a gun at China, but also other countries and regions including the European Union, Canada, Mexico, India and Russia. Such typical unilateralism and trade protectionism undermine global supply chain, damage the multilateral trading system, and diminish the soft power of the US. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations, cautioned that the US tariff policies would lead to worldwide confrontation against the US. Many analysts believe that the US administration is to a great extent canvassing for the mid-term election to be held in November. The spokesperson of Chinaâs Ministry of Commerce once said that the US is firing shots to the world, including to itself. The trade war would inevitably harm the interests of US farmers, businesses and consumers, thus putting negative impacts on the Republicansâ polls. It is reported that the US Chamber of Commerce has launched a campaign against the US tariff policy and will raise millions of US dollars to back candidates who support free trade in the mid-term election. Of course, China would also suffer from losses in this trade war, but it has no choices but to hit back. China needs to teach the US a lesson out the necessities to safeguard its own interests, protect the multilateral trading system, refute the slanders put upon by the US, and better introduce China to each sector of the American society. China has to fight back out of the consideration to insist on equal relations among countries and defend the principle of credibility. China must make the US learn from its mistakes and realize that the trade war is a disaster to itself, the other countries, as well as the whole world at large. China hopes that the US could step back from the brink and find a way back to correct track. It is believed that more and more countries will join China during this battle against the US unilateralism and trade protectionism. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Judging by the broad appreciation of China's trade policies and practices expressed by numerous country delegations at its recently-concluded seventh WTO Trade Policy Review in Geneva, Mr. Lighthizer's observations are unrepresentative and misguided. (File photo) China's accession to the WTO on December 11, 2001, following a protracted 15 years of negotiations, was the biggest coming-out party in the history of development. Its active role within the organization as well as the important contributions to global growth in the subsequent decade-and-a-half is an eloquent testimony to the virtues of reform and opening-up and the benefits of cooperative multilateralism. And, ironically, far from disadvantaging America, it has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of China's entry. As China's average tariff rate on manufactured goods shrank from 15 percent in 2001 to single digits today, US exports of goods have risen from $19 billion in 2001 to $127 billion in 2017 â an almost seven-fold increase. Furthermore, over the past decade, US exports of goods to China have grown by 86 percent compared to 21 percent to the rest of the world. Lighthizer's observation that the US erred in supporting China's entry into the WTO is also deeply disrespectful. Given its late date of entry (it entered as the organization's 143rd member), China was obliged to accept accession commitments and encumbrances that substantially exceeded those made by other acceding countries or by member-states at a comparable level of development. Deep mandated tariff cuts aside, these limits on its trading freedoms included an interim China-specific safeguard, an interim special textile safeguard as well as the right of trading partners to treat China as a non-market economy for 15 years during anti-dumping investigations. (VCG Photo) China has displayed a humble and remedial attitude, too, when faced with adverse judgments within the WTO's dispute settlement system. No case of countermeasures pursuant to Article 22.6 of the dispute settlement understanding for not having complied with an arbitral verdict has been sought by a trading partner against China. The same cannot be said of the multilateral trading system's other major countries. The US, in particular, features prominently within this Article 22.6 roll of shame. China has been a diligent rule-taker in the multilateral trading system. Looking ahead, as China transitions from being a great trading power to a great trading and investment power, it must now also become a rule-maker that helps craft the rules-of-the-road for a deepened investment framework in the multilateral system. At the 11th ministerial conference in Buenos Aires in December 2017, a subset of WTO members including China resolved to pursue structured discussions leading to the creation of a multilateral framework on investment facilitation. China must take a co-leadership role within these discussions and devise an adaptive, responsive and resilient facilitation framework â one that substantially liberalizes global investment flows across a range of goods and services sectors while protecting the right of countries to regulate in the public interest to meet their policy objectives. Along the way, China should also modify certain foreign inward investment-related practices which, rightly or wrongly, have caused misgivings among its trading partners. These misgivings, which were aired at the recent WTO trade policy review, relate to the as-yet preponderant role of the state in general, and its inconsistent administrative and regulatory practices related to technology transfer requirements in particular. These include intellectual property rights-related regulations which, at times, appear to depart from the 'national treatment' principle and accord less favorable treatment to foreign intellectual property rights-holders compared to domestic Chinese rights-holders in the course of technology transactions. The 'national treatment' principle as well as the 'most favored nation' principle has been the foundational pillar of the international trading system. In the hands of imperial powers, the latter was utilized as a tool of subjugation and abuse. As Article 8 of the supplement to the Opium-era Treaty of Nanjing, the principle provided the basis for foreign powers to exploitatively strip China of control over its customs boundary and tariff-levying powers. In the post-World War II age of sovereign equality of nation-states, the two principles have been a powerful force for good, providing a ladder of development that allowed countries to break out of poverty traps and grow wealthy. As China becomes a prodigious exporter of capital as part of its Belt and Road initiative (BRI), it must now take the lead in mainstreaming the 'national treatment' principle and the 'most favored nation' principle within the WTO's embryonic multilateral framework on investment facilitation. ""That international trade should be abundant, that it should be multilateral, that it should be non-discriminatory"" was the widely-expressed sentiment at the Preparatory Committee gathered in October 1946 to frame the charter for the post-war global trading order. China must endeavor to inscribe that sentiment as the guiding principles of the 21st century global investment order too. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The question can only be answered after evaluation of multiple factors on production and trading links. Only when the domestic production cost in China remains on the same level while the US imports has infinite price elasticity of demand, the trade war would severely threaten Chinese industries. But the fact is that the cost of exported commodities usually has enough flexible room during production and trading, thus leaving the impact on China limited. Under the background of Chinaâs supply-side structural reform, a tax reduction would be the most direct approach to cope with trade protectionism by lowering costs. Having similar effect as fiscal subsidies, a tax cut is in line with the big direction of Chinaâs ongoing structural adjustment and economic reform, while not violating related World Trade Organization (WTO) rules such as the anti-subsidy duties. The exchange rate of the Chinese yuan that would be lower in the medium term will be another factor, in that a downward slide of its exchange rate can effectively ease the negative influence of the increased tariffs. The intra-trade and internal settlement is another weapon to buffer the costs. After the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008, China has seen more and more of its enterprises seeking opportunities overseas, giving rise to a great number of small- and medium-sized transnational corporations. These enterprises are able to change the rules of origin without making large-scale production transfer through the approaches such as intra-trade and internal settlement, and export their products through third-party countries. Especially with Chinaâs continuous industrial adjustment and upgrading, the country has established its comprehensive competitiveness in the production of intermediate goods that require certain extent of technological integration. After investing in the large-scale production in Southeast Asia in recent years, China has preliminarily built a regional production and trading network led by Chinese transnational companies. As a result, such labor division adjustment can be easily completed in the production network of Asia. Besides, China is undergoing industrial transmission and making its economy ârealâ again. After an over-development of fictitious sector, which was the largest threat for Chinese economy in the last decade, China is now pulling itself back and getting to the track of real economy once again. Though those irrational days witnessed unwise capital flow into the internet industry and the mismatch of social capitals, the false prosperity is getting back under control with systematic management of financial risks. The difficult financing of some fictitious economy projects in the first half of 2018 was a living proof. The recovery of real economy, which is structural, can not find a clue immediately in statistics such as purchasing managers' index (PMI), but the trend is unstoppable. The wholly-owned factory built by the US electric vehicle maker Tesla in Shanghai indicates the coming of a new era. Lingang New Area, where the factory locates, is a cluster of industries including international manufacturers of machine tools and robots. The mass production and supply of production materials will result in wide-ranging reform of technology and raise efficiency of domestic manufacturing industry. Over the past years, the progress in mechanization has been reshaping Chinaâs competitive edge in manufacturing sector. Thanks to Chinaâs enhanced efforts in intensive, as well as technology- and capital-centered production, its advances in technology will substantially ease the impact of the price elasticity of demand on the industry. The conclusion can also be echoed by the agreement recently reached by Chinese and German automakers. After years of studies and confusion, China has been policy-ready to face a new round of industrial upgrading and transformation. The redesign of production layout by BMW and Volkswagen in the Yangtze River economic belt is a response to the call of the Chinese market with huge demand, and also an important proof of Chinese citiesâ progress in industry growth and business environment.

It said global growth is projected to reach 3.9 percent in 2018 and 2019, but the expansion is becoming less even, and risks to the outlook are mounting. The outlook is also clouded by ongoing trade tensions and anticipated tariff increases by the United States and retaliatory measures by trading partners. Itâs believed that these measures have increased the likelihood of escalating and sustained trade actions which could derail the recovery and depress medium-term growth prospects, both through their direct impact on resource allocation and productivity and by raising uncertainty and taking a toll on investment. Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, the Deputy Director in the Research Department of the IMF, is responsible for supervising the department's work on multilateral surveillance. He had an exclusive interview with Peopleâs Daily. âThe measures implemented so far have been a relatively modest by the standards of the size of the globe economy. They still matter. A few days ago a imf report estimates that the restrictions visible in the US implemented by the US and steel and aluminum retaliation and increased uncertainty about global trade can take over half a percent of GDP by 2020.â Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti said. In the past few months, the United States has imposed tariffs on a variety of imports, prompting retaliatory measures from trading partners. An escalation of trade tensions could undermine business and financial market sentiment, denting investment and trade. Beyond its immediate toll on market sentiment, the proliferation of trade measures could increase the uncertainty about the potential breadth of trade actions, thus hindering investment, while higher trade barriers would make tradable goods less affordable, disrupt global supply chains, and slow the spread of new technologies, thus lowering productivity. As US always believes that the trade deficit with china means china is taking advantages of US. Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti said âUS current account trade deficits in the aggregate has the reflection of the fact that the US residents spend a bit more than what they are producing.âIn his view, with a policy of reducing the tax rate and having some additional spending on the public sector side, we are getting more support to US activity to US demand, but also pressures for the current account deficit to get wider. âSo we tend to focus on the aggregate figures for the country as a whole rather than on bilateral policies with individual country,âhe said. Substantial fiscal stimulus together with already-robust private final demand will lift output further above potential and lower the unemployment rate below levels last registered 50 years ago, creating additional inflationary pressures. Imports are set to pick up with stronger domestic demand, increasing the US current account deficit and widening excess global imbalances. âItâs quite clear that these restrictions are hurting businessâ.âWe hope that countries will come together and agree on a mutually beneficial set of measures that would actually ease rather than restrict trade down the trading goods and trade services being investment being treatmentâhe added. Mr. Milesi-Ferretti also highlight the importance of multilateral trade system. He said the multilateral trade system has been very important pillar of the global expansion in the post world war. China itself has grown by leaps and bounds since that's joined for the lateral trade system. âI think the positive side of it is that countries could work together to try to extend a multilateral trade system in those directions to strengthen. It's a promotion. Its support for free trading services, its support for treatment of intellectual property. And that could be expansion for the global economyâ. The WEO point out the multilateral cooperation remains vital to address challenges that transcend countriesâ borders. Global economic integration under an open, ruleâbased multilateral trade system has raised living standards, helped lift productivity, and spread innovation throughout the world. To preserve and broaden these gains, countries should work together to reduce trade costs further and resolve disagreements without raising tariff and non-tariff barriers. âWe are a multilateral institution. This we think that a cooperative approach to multilateral policy choices is essential that integration is ultimately good for countriesâ.But he also reminded that there are clearly factors need to take into account. âWhen we look at the global integration, we need to take into account that not not all segments of society are affected the same way by integration, that there are segments of society that may a loose from specific aspects of integratio, say workers that are displaced by further trade integration. And we have to take those aspects very seriouslyâ. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

China wouldn't use yuan depreciation as a weapon to cope with negative effects from the trade tension with the US, said Zhou Yu, director of the Research Center of International Finance at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences on Sunday. ""Depreciation of the yuan might offset the influence of higher US tariffs, but it wouldn't do much good for China's economy. It might bring bad consequences like capital outflows. China wants the yuan to be stable and wouldn't want it to depreciate significantly,"" Zhou said. His view was echoed by Cong Yi, an economics professor at the Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, who said that it's the US, not the Chinese government, that has caused the yuan to depreciate. The trade tension has caused a deterioration in China's international trade balance, which has in turn brought capital outflows and depreciation pressure on the yuan, Zhou and Cong both said. In a twitter post from Trump on Friday, he accused China, the EU and others of devaluing their currencies and lowering interest rates while the US dollar gets stronger, taking away a ""big competitive edge"" from the US. But Zhou noted that Trump's views do not necessarily represent the US government's stance. For example, in its biannual report on international exchange rates released by the US Treasury in April, it decided not to label China a currency manipulator. US strategy A CNBC report on Friday noted that the tit-for-tat Sino-US trade dispute has turned into a ""currency war"" between the two economies, with both currencies depreciating in recent days. On Friday, the yuan's reference rate against the US dollar weakened by 605 basis points to 6.7671, data from the People's Bank of China, China's central bank, showed. On January 2, the first trading day this year, the yuan stood at 6.5079 against the US dollar. And the US dollar index edged down 0.72 percent to 94.48 on Friday. According to Cong, there is no basis for long-term depreciation of the yuan, as China is making efforts to decrease reliance upon exports and increase dependence on domestic demand. ""Besides, US companies are also increasing investment in China amid slumping demand in the US. That trend is irreversible,"" he said. In early July, US car maker Tesla signed a deal with Chinese authorities to build a new auto plant in Shanghai, according to media reports. Zhou noted that it's the US government that's likely to intervene in the currency market to maintain its benefits from the tariff increase on Chinese goods. ""I think the US government will make some efforts to prevent a rise in the US dollar, against the background of interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, as they don't want the effects of the trade measures to be completely watered down by the depreciating yuan,"" Zhou said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

In his opinion, the United States has been the main source for unilateral trade protectionism since the Second World War, especially with non-tariff measures. ""In 1944, the U.S. played a dominant role in the construction of the international monetary system with the U.S. dollar as the leading currency, and established the World Bank, ensuring the U.S. hegemony in global economy and trade. ""In 1947, the U.S. implemented the Marshall Plan in the western Europe on condition that Charles de Gaulle must resign from the government,"" said RÃ¼gemer. In 1948, the U.S. proposed to establish the Paris-based Coordinating Committee for Export Control (COCOM) to restrict the trade of high-tech products with socialist countries,"" he continued. According to the expert, the U.S. protectionism also influenced its best allies --- West Germany, based on the fact that the U.S. imposed a ban on the oil and gas trade between West Germany and Russia in 1960s. ""In 1975, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) was established to prevent Japanese investment in the U.S., and this committee is still operating effectively,"" RÃ¼gemer added. In regard to the influence of U.S. trade protectionism to China, RÃ¼gemer pointed out that the U.S. had been setting obstacles for China's accession to WTO until 2001. ""The U.S. former President Barack Obama has also announced executive order to prohibit Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund (FGC)'s acquisition of German semi-conductor company Aixtron,"" RÃ¼gemer indicated. Earlier, the U.S. has announced tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the European Union (EU), Canada and Mexico. Recently, it has released several tariff lists of Chinese goods amid strong opposition from China and U.S. business groups. In RÃ¼gemer's view, all these actions would bring negative impact on world economy directly. In the meanwhile, he pointed out that the growth in the western economy led by U.S. shows many structural problems, including unstable growth in the financial sector, possible financial bubble with economic downturn, and very imbalanced growth between workers, middle classes and big private owners. RÃ¼gemer said, both China and Germany benefit from economic globalization, adding that workers' representatives, managers and shareholders in Germany all have the experience that Chinese investments are positive, for working places, for economic stability and growth, for technical exchange and for opening a much broader market. ""Under the pressure from the U.S. government, we should seek new ways for the China-EU and China-Germany cooperation,"" said RÃ¼gemer. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

[Photo/Xinhua] China is confident in how it deals with external challenges and is further tapping the domestic market potential while accelerating the pace of negotiations with the European Union to reach a quality bilateral investment treaty, the Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday. Gao Feng, the ministry's spokesman, said the United States is bullying the rest of the world with a big stick in the form of tariffs while claiming how innocent it is. His comments came after some US officials recently blamed China for ""negotiation failure"". Gao said such an accusation is not true and China has been serious in resolving the trade dispute via negotiation in the four rounds of talks since February. The spokesman reiterated that China's stance on trade tensions with the US has always been the same. The country will work with other economies to support international rules and the multilateral trading system, he said. As for the US proposed additional tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, Gao said China will be forced to and certainly will take countermeasures when necessary. Also on Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that US accusations of higher Chinese tariffs on US goods and pilfering US innovations are not convincing. She made the statement when asked to comment on remarks of US Vice-President Mike Pence at the US Department of Commerce on Monday, accusing China of levying tariffs on the country's goods three times higher than US tariffs on Chinese goods, and of stealing US technologies. Hua said China always upholds fair trade and is advancing a new round of opening-up in order to create an open, transparent and fair business environment. However, the US made various excuses and even used reasons like national security to create obstacles and restrictions on China's investment and business activities in the US, she said. The Ministry of Commerce said China aims to make more progress in talks regarding the China-EU bilateral investment treaty, as both sides exchanged market access offers during the 20th China-EU Leaders' Meeting, which concluded in Beijing earlier this week. Eager to restore their developing abilities, each side agreed to make negotiation of the agreement a top priority and strive to build an open, transparent, fair and predictable business environment for investors. Zhang Yuyan, director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said facing an environment of escalating US trade friction, Chinese investors will gradually turn to European partners for investment opportunities. ""The attitude of Chinese investors will not change if the US insists on going in an unpleasant way,"" Zhang said. Wei Jianguo, former-vice minister of commerce, said the US is not only targeting China, but also treating the whole world as an opponent. ""It will drag the global economy into danger,"" he said.

Even various groups in US worry about the trade war. Leading American motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson Inc. was an early casualty of the trade war, as it was forced to shift some of the production of its iconic motorcycles out of US in response to the retaliatory tariffs imposed by European Union on June 25. As tensions escalate, General Electric (GE) was also quick with both dividend cut and booting from the Dow Jones industrial average, reported Investors.com. The USâs trade war is tantamount to erecting an invisible wall between international businesses. The trade war will not only hamper the efficient supply-chain of goods on a global level, but also lead to a corresponding rise in prices and less investment by corporations. According to a research by Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a public policy think tank based in the US, a 25% tariff on information-and-technology products will result in a loss of approximately $332 billion in the US economy over the next decade. In order to counter such measures, major trading partners have to impose $90-billion tariffs on the US, which could threaten employment in the US. A $6-billion loss is likely to take place in the near future when soybean buyers lose their price advantage in the Chinese market due to 600 yuan-per-ton price increase, the American Soybean Association has estimated. There is no winner in a trade war, as unilateral action to impose tariffs has never been successful strategy. In 2002, the US government imposed tariffs on imported steel products, resulting in a net loss of about 200,000 American jobs. In 2009, the US government placed tariffs on imported tires from China, leading to a net loss of approximately 2,500 American jobs. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The tariffs, which were launched under Section 301, aim to âpunishâ what Trump has called Chinaâs âtheftâ of intellectual property and unequal industrial policies, though ironically, around 59 percent of products (worth $34 billion) subject to the additional tariffs are made by foreign firms in China, with American firms making up a considerable part. In response to the rising tension between the worldâs largest economic engines, Peopleâs Daily released a commentary on Monday, calling the tariffs âtypical unilateralism, protectionism and trade bullying.â Even western media outlets that had previously endorsed Americaâs attempts to balance its trade deficit with China have since denounced the formerâs reckless move, with CBS News noting that there are no easy off-ramps to the trade war, while the BBC warned that the rising tension âcould hurt us all.â âTrade war will benefit no one. Ordinary Americans will also suffer from such a reckless decision, while the Trump administration will feel the backlash months later,â said Paul Chan Poh Hoi, a Peopleâs Daily reader. âU.S.-China trade is coming as the U.S. is trying to maintain its monopoly position, as well as its hegemony that aims to [prioritize only] the national interest of America,â added Michel McGill, a U.S.-based Quora user. Trade bully Despite criticism from both global leaders and financial institutions, Trump reiterated last week that though America is now in a ânasty trade battle with China, things would ultimately work out.â But his optimism received a cold response from many U.S. members of the public and media outlets, with CNN depicting the last trade war as ânot working out so great.â âThe world economy relies on international trade and Trump has decided to attack it. Do we honestly believe the U.S. market could keep going up forever in the face of mounting pressure?â Adam Alton, a U.S. netizen commented on Facebook. Echoing Alton, Serafina Calise, another U.S. netizen, noted that the U.S. has started a war âit will not win.â The Chinese government has also slammed the U.S.-initiated trade war, with its Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen calling the U.S. a trade bully. âAmericaâs initiation of a trade war was led by its protectionist and nationalist policies. When it comes to its own interests, the U.S. bullies everyone, including bodies like the WTO and UN. Thatâs so hypercritical,â said Harishwr K, a German-based Quora user. Global turbulence In addition to China, the U.S. has also launched trade wars targeting other nations, with many WTO members taking countermeasures against it, as well as requesting consultations with the States under the WTO dispute settlement mechanism. Delivering sharp rebukes against U.S. unilateral protectionism, Sputnik, Russiaâs major news portal, has warned that U.S.-China trade skirmishes could end in a global trade war. Sharing the same opinion, The Guardian noted that Trumpâs trade war will soon have fallout, but as with Brexit, the economic effects of uncertainty over tariffs will take time to appear. According to DBSâs chief economist Taimur Baig, such a trade war could shave 0.25 percent off the GDP of both China and the U.S. this year. However, considering Chinese GDP grows at 6-7 percent while that of the U.S. only grows at 2-3 percent, the damage would be greater to the U.S. than to China. The International Monetary Fund has also warned that the trade war could cost the global economy $430 billion, affecting many countries, but America will be especially vulnerable to an escalating tariff war. âBoth the U.S. and China economy are fully integrated into the world economy; any trade war between the U.S. and China will negatively impact the entire world,â said Glenn Lee, a netizen from Northern California."

""China has always fulfilled its obligations, kept its promises and made significant contributions to the world economy by paying great efforts and costs since it joined the WTO 17 years ago,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a routine press briefing. Recently, the United States has issued multiple reports accusing China of violating WTO rules, and used these to justify implementing unilateral trade measures against China. Hua said that since 2002, China's annual average contribution to world economic growth had been close to 30 percent. ""If China hadn't abided by WTO rules, why would it have chosen to join the WTO?"" she said. The Chinese government decided to join the organization because it firmly believes integration into economic globalization is in line with the historical trend and that promoting free, open trade leads to mutually beneficial and win-win results, according to the spokesperson. ""If China hadn't abided by WTO rules, why would it have fulfilled the obligations of joining the organization?"" she asked. Hua pointed out that China had recently released a white paper, ""China and the World Trade Organization."" ""Speaking with facts and figures, the paper clearly shows that China has fully fulfilled its commitments in terms of tax reductions on goods, opening of trade in services, and non-tariff measures including import quotas,"" she said. ""If China hadn't abided by WTO rules, why would it have always safeguarded the core values and basic principles of the WTO?"" she continued. China firmly believes that the authority and effectiveness of the multilateral trading system can be protected only by adhering to the international rules in the spirit of contract, Hua said. ""China will never take unilateral measures easily or violate WTO fundamental rules. When handling key issues, it keeps its word and takes responsibility,"" the spokesperson said. China's efforts in abiding by the WTO rules and fulfilling its commitments have gained worldwide recognition. According to Hua, the United States has consecutively released 16 reports on China's fulfillment of its commitments to the WTO, none of which have suggested any violation of rules except for one released this year. ""The United States not only puts its own interests above global interests, but also places its domestic rules on top of international rules,"" she said. ""None of the countries within the WTO support the United States' unilateral actions."" ""China will continue to abide by WTO rules.

[Photo/VCG] China lodged a complaint on Monday to the World Trade Organization regarding the United States' proposed tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement. It followed the recent complaint that the ministry filed on July 6 to the WTO about the US' early round of levies on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods. US tariff hikes targeting Chinese goods were based on Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, its domestic trade law. ""The US' unilateral initiation of a trade war has no international legal basis at all,"" the ministry said last week in a point-by-point response to the US statement under Section 301. The US unilaterally launched a Section 301 investigation against China last year despite opposition from China and the international community. It released an investigation report in March, and imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods on July 6 in disregard of 91 percent opposition in the comments it received. ""The (US) tariffs are typical unilateralism, protectionism and trade bullying. They are a clear violation of the basic WTO principle of most-favored-nation treatment as well as the basic spirit and principles of international law,"" the ministry stressed. Wan Zhe, chief economist of International Cooperation Center with National Development and Reform Commission, said the real intention of the US government initiating trade conflicts with other countries is to distract attention from its internal contradictions, such as the wealth gap and job losses. Against such a backdrop, what China should do is to continue to push ahead with economic reform and opening-up, and work with the rest of the world to support free trade and multilateralism, Wan said at a recent seminar. Dong Yan, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said China should firmly uphold the multilateral trading system while sticking to its established agenda of further opening-up."

China declares determination to guard multilateral trading system âChina was forced into taking reciprocal countermeasures, which indicated its strong resolution to oppose unilateralism, support the multilateral trading system, and protect the authoritativeness and effectiveness of the system,â said Zhang Yansheng, chief researcher with the China Center for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEC). Chinaâs countermeasures start from its determination to safeguard its core national interests and the fundamental interests of its people, Zhang said, adding that against the backdrop of intertwined world economy, the US is simply adopting a bullying practice with unilateralism and protectionism by initiating the trade war. The US is seemingly trying to reduce trade deficits under the banner of imbalanced trade, but it indeed hopes to comprehensively contain the development of other countries, the expert unmasked the veil of the US. Statistics showed that nearly 60 percent of the products on the $34 billion tariff list of the US are produced by foreign enterprises in China, and a considerable part of them comes from the US itself. In light of this, by unilaterally initiating the trade war, the US side is firing at the whole world as well as itsel, said Zhang, explaining that such irrational act is extremely dangerous and will lead to a lose-lose situation. The multilateralism, free trade and rules-based order are pit against unilateralism, protectionism and power games, researcher Sun Jie from the Institute of World Economics and Politics under Chinese Academy of Social Sciences pointed out. Sun believes that the core of the trade war lies in the intention of the US to abandon the existing multilateral trading system and highlight the so-called fairness and reciprocal opening in bilateral trade relations, so that it will be able to increase tariffs on a unilateral basis. Such practice has brought huge impacts and destruction to the current global trade system, he warned. âSustainable and win-win results never come along with unilateral act that goes against multilateral system or global governing principles,â the researcher noted. Chinaâs reciprocal countermeasures after the irrational move of the US, as well as its complaint of such unilateral practice to the World Trade Organization (WTO) are totally in line with the fundamental principles and spirit of the international law, he stressed. China is supported by international morality, Sun said, adding that the international society should work together to resolutely oppose unilateralism and protectionism. An opener China will benefit world more China will never back down from the trade war, said Chen Wenling, chief economist of the CCIEC. It will work with other countries to safeguard the global free trade system, multilateral mechanism, and international rules, she noted, adding that the country will focus on its own issues and firmly carry forward reform and opening up. Chen remarked that the USâ denial of the globally accepted multilateral trading system is a willful violation of the international rules and order, putting negative impacts on global trade system, as well as the global industrial, supply and value chains. In a belief that such movement of the US will not only hurt China, but also the US and the world economy at large, Chen called on the world to firmly oppose the bullying practices of the US and protect the principle of free trade and the multilateral trade system. China is the worldâs only country that has established a whole industrial chain. It has a huge domestic market and development potential, thus enjoying a larger elbow room when facing with external impacts, said Bai Ming, deputy director of the International Market Research Institute under the Ministry of Commerce. âThe US will finally expose its weaknesses and problems as time goes by, and the country will gradually get stung by Chinaâs countermeasures,â Bai said, explaining that China has always been a country that is able to bounce high when pressed by external forces. China has already showcased its resolution to further open up, which can be evidenced by the slew of new measures regarding opening up in just four days from June 26 to July 1. The country also issued two new negative lists: one that applies to the free trade zones and another for the rest of the country, largely lowering the market access. In addition, it rolled out new regulation for foreign enterprises registration, allowing simultaneous online documentation and commercial registration for overseas companies coming to China. Besides, it also substantially lowered the tariffs of wholesale automobiles, auto parts, cosmetics and aquatic products. âA more open China will definitely bring more opportunities for the world,â Bai noted. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Experts believe that the US approach is a unilateral approach prohibited by the WTO's Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU), and violates the most basic spirit and principles of the WTO. That China was forced to take counteractions is an inevitable choice to defend national interests and global interests, and is perfectly rightful, reasonable and lawful. ""The section 301 investigation was initiated, investigated, decided and executed by the United States itself and has a strong characteristic of unilateralism, "" said Bai Ming, deputy director of the MOC International Market Research Institute. Given that, the Section 301 has been widely criticized ever since its enactment. ""It is not surprising that the economic and trade cooperation between economic powers can be frictional. The key is to adopt a reasonable and legal solution, rather than arbitrarily adopting unilateralism and protectionism."" Bai Ming said. The Section 301 refers to an investigation under Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, a law that allows the US president to unilaterally impose tariffs on another country. As Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics once put in a metaphor - The US government acted as police force (identifying the foreign governmentâs crime), prosecutor (making the legal arguments), jury (ruling on the evidence), and judge (sentencing the foreigner to US retaliatory punishment). In August 2017, the US launched the Section 301 investigation against China despite opposition from China and the international community. The US released a Section 301 investigation report in March 2018 and imposed 25 percent tariffs on 34 billion U.S. dollars worth of Chinese exports to the US on July 6 in disregard of 91-percent opposition in the comments it received. On July 11, the US further escalated the situation by announcing a tariff list of Chinese products worth 200 billion U.S. dollars. They are a clear violation of the basic WTO principle of most-favored-nation treatment as well as the basic spirit and principles of international law. Also, the tariffs are typical unilateralism, protectionism and trade bullying, said Wang Qijiang, the vice chairman of the China Law Society. The US has violated its commitment to free trade and should be stopped jointly by relevant parties and led back to the right track of WTO principles. The US has totally turned its back on the framework of global multi-lateral trade, demanding only the one-side interest, which is not only disobeying the principles of global trade, but also unlikely to get the advantage. The âfair tradeâ that the US claims is a clear âprotectionismâ under the name of fairness. That China was forced to take counteractions is an inevitable choice to defend national interests and global interests, and is perfectly rightful, reasonable and lawful. It also demonstrates Chinaâs resolution and determination to protect the WTO multi-lateral system and the international law, said Zhang Monan, a researcher from the China Center for International Economic Exchanges. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The White House resorted to unilateral trade protectionism, which laid a âterror trapâ and wantonly hit the global industrial chain and the value chain. This, however, does not mean that the US has the power to dominate the world, and it is by no means something worth showing off. It is noted that anxiety in the US is growing. Up to 73% of respondents worry that trade war will do them harm, according to polls conducted by influential media including Washington Post. Industrial transfer and technology spillovers are inevitable in economic globalization and is an important way to realize the interests of developed countries. In the current global division of labor led by multinational corporations, the biggest beneficiaries of technology spillovers are developed countries represented by the US. There is no âforced technology transferâ. The Chinese government did not make this kind of request to foreign companies, and cooperation between Chinese and foreign companies in technology and other economic and trade field is contract behavior purely based on voluntary principle. In 2017, China's external payments for IPR royalty totaled 28.6 billion U.S. dollars, and the US remained its status as the largest payment receiver. Thus Americaâs threat of sanctions and restrictions on China using the excuse of so-called âforced technology transferâ is untenable and has a bad effect. It is a basic development right for developing countries to promote industrialization and modernization through normal international trade and investment. The US unilaterally intervenes in international affairs and imposes domestic law on other countries. As a result, enterprises that normally carry out international trade and investment are exposed to huge risks and may be subjected to US sanctions at any time. Abuse of âlong-arm jurisdictionâ of the US has disrupted the international economic and trade order and is a great threat to enterprises in all countries. Investment layout based on the global industrial chain and value chain is normal for enterprises and is the basic law of market economy. However, the US administration even abused the label of âtraitorsâ and repeatedly put pressure on multinational corporations to return to the US by means of threatening to raise taxes. Such practice has severely interfered with the normal business decisions of enterprises, hurting the global market economy. Countries use their comparative advantage and cooperate with each other and the world economy has become a highly efficient global industrial chain and value chain. The US has imposed tariffs on trading partners in violation of WTO rules. It is actually a tax on enterprises in all countries of the global industrial chain, including American enterprises in its trading partners. The increase in tariffs and non-tariff barriers will slow the spread of new technologies, resulting in a decline in global productivity and investment. The White House has impacted severely on the global industrial chain and value chain by a series of actions including suppressing normal technology spillovers and abusing the âlong-arm jurisdictionâ. The fight against American trade hegemony to advocate multilateral and free trade helps safeguard the common interests of all peoples around the world and accelerate the formation of a more equitable and reasonable international economic and trade order. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

International trade is based on voluntary principle and both sides have reaped huge benefit from the cooperation over the years. What is unreasonable is why the US, the most powerful country, has become the âbiggest victimâ of âimbalanceâ? Are the former owners of the White House really happy to sell their own interests, or are they too weak to argue with their trading partners? The US claimed that when doing business with other countries, the US has such a large trade deficit that it has to adopt strong solutions, and that trading partners are unfair to the US, thus harming its economy, industries and employment. However, according to the results found by a statistical working group made up of experts from government agencies in China and the US, the US official trade deficit with China is overestimated by about 20% every year. Besides, trade data cited by the US government only includes trade in goods and does not reflect trade in services. The US service sector accounts for more than 70% of its GDP. How can the US lose such a large sum when calculating trade accounts? The reason is very simple. The surplus of US trade in services is not small. If this surplus is included, the so-called âChina-US trade imbalanceâ will be even more untenable. Trade deficit is not the same thing as interest deficit. In the global value chain, the trade surplus is reflected in China, whereas the interest surplus is in the US, according to a research report on Sino-US economic and trade relations released by the MOC. Last year, 57% of China's trade surplus was from foreign-invested companies, and 59% came from processing trade. China only earns a small amount of processing fees from processing trade, while the US makes huge profits from design, parts supply, and marketing. In the Sino-US economic and trade cooperation, the US imports a large number of low-cost labor-intensive products from China and American consumers have enjoyed real benefits, which is also conducive to the US in curbing domestic inflation. China does not deliberately pursue trade surplus in its trade with other countries. China has actively expanded its imports in line with the people's growing needs for a better life and high-quality economic development. On July 1, China actively reduced tariffs for daily consumer goods involving 1,449 tax items, with an average fall of 55.9%. According to the so-called âfairâ trade advocated by the US, countries must be completely consistent with the US in terms of the tariff for each specific product and the access of each specific industry to achieve absolute reciprocity. Tariff levels and openness have always been closely related to a countryâs development stage, resource endowment and industrial competitiveness. The so-called âfairâ trade essentially denies the national conditions and development stages of various countries, which will inevitably have huge impact on the economies and industries of developing countries, and will inevitably lead to a wider range of unfairness. Pursuing protectionism is like locking oneself in a dark room. While wind and rain may be kept outside, that dark room will also block light and air. International trade seeks to achieve mutual benefit and win-win outcomes. No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

They made the conclusion as the WTO finished its seventh trade policy review (TPR) of China on Friday. During the week-long evaluation, the members reviewed the report on Chinaâs trade policy drafted independently by the WTO Secretariat, which summed up Chinaâs performance in the last two years. A policy statement submitted by China, in which the Chinese government elaborated how it implemented its trade policy over the two years, was assessed by the members as well. âDuring the review period, the Chinese economy continued to be a major driver of global economic growth,â the report said, predicting a more stable, albeit lower growth as well as rates of around 7% per year in the foreseeable future. âGrowth rebalances from investment to consumption, from external to internal demand, and from manufacturing to services,â the report added. The Chinese government has been trying to address these issues by focusing on the quality and sustainability rather than the quantity of growth, lauded the report, adding that reforms have advanced across many areas, including the introduction of measures to reduce overcapacity, strengthen local government borrowing frameworks, and address financial sector risks. âChina continues to be one of the world's largest recipients of foreign direct investment (FDI),â WTO Secretariat wrote in the report, explaining that FDI inflows have been growing for a number of years. Major recipients of investment inflows were manufacturing, real-estate, leasing and business services and wholesale and retail trade, the body expounded. Describing China as a significant overseas investor, the report pointed out that its outward FDI has also been trending upwards for a number of years. China is an active member of the WTO, the report noted, saying that during the period under review, China signed two free trade agreements with the Maldives and Georgia, bringing the total number to 16. The report also underlined that China continues to grant unilateral trade preferences to least developed countries (LDCs), and as of this March, duty-free treatment on 97% of tariff lines was granted to 36 LDCs that have diplomatic relations with China and completed the exchange of notes. China has made modifications and reforms to its trade and investment policies and measures since the previous review, said Eloi Laourou, chairperson of the TPR body, citing its endeavor to revise the catalogue for guiding foreign investment and establish 11 free trade pilot zones. Laourou, also Benin's ambassador to the United Nations offices in Geneva, hailed Chinaâs reforms on trade facilitation as well. About one third of imports are now declared through single windows, and clearance times of imports were reduced to an average of 16.7 hours in 2017 from over 22 hours in 2016, he elaborated, adding that clearance times for exports were further reduced during the period under review, to a nationwide average of 1.1 hours in 2017. According to him, China, as an observer to the Committee on Government Procurement, is in the process of negotiating its accession to the Plurilateral Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), and also as a participant in the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), it has agreed to its expansion. WTO members highlighted the importance of China's contribution to global growth in recent years and expressed appreciation for China's active role in the WTO, Laourou said in the concluding remarks of the review. âChina, being the world's biggest merchandise trader and one of the largest recipients of FDI, its policies have a direct impact on the global economy,"" he added. ""Hence, (the WTO) members called upon China to assume the increased responsibility linked with being a major player in the multilateral trading system,"" said the chairperson. Since China joined the trade body in 2001, its role in the system has increased a lot, which has also been agreed by the review this time, WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo told the Peopleâs Daily. Its exports have been increased by seven times and imports by six times, he said, adding that China also lifted more than 700 million people out of poverty. Thumbs up should be given to these remarkable achievements, the WTO chief said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

(Photo from Peopleâs Daily Online) China has created significant opportunities and made great contributions to world economic and trade growth since its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) 17 years ago, a senior Chinese official said on Thursday. Wang Shouwen, China's vice minister of commerce, made the remarks at a press briefing on a white paper titled ""China and the World Trade Organization"", a document released by China's State Council Information Office for the first time on June 28. During the briefing attended by over 30 reporters, Wang, also deputy China international trade representative, elaborated Chinaâs principled stand and policies on construction of multilateral trade system, as well as Chinaâs visions and actions for an opener market. Over the past 17 years, China has grown into a major engine driving world economic recovery and growth, with a contribution of nearly 30 percent on average per year to global economic growth, Wang said, pledging that China will continue its support to the multilateral trading system advocated by the WTO. China had also honored all of its commitments on trade in services by 2007, as 100 sub-sectors under nine sectors had already been opened up then, he said, adding that China never stopped its endeavor in widening market access of investment even though the WTO did not set special requirement for the country in this regard. China, since its entry into the WTO, has made faithful efforts to fulfill its promises and to integrate itself into the multilateral trading system, according to the official. Citing the trade in goods as an example, Wang said that China fulfilled all of its tariff reduction commitments as early as in 2010, with its average tariff level down to 9.8 percent from 15.3 percent in 2001. ""China has endeavored to liberalize and facilitate trade and investment, safeguarded the dispute settlement mechanism, fully participated in trade policy review, and vigorously supported the integration of developing members into the multilateral trading system,"" Wang said. As a staunch dissenter of unilateralism and trade protectionism, China has protected the authority and effectiveness of multilateral trading system with concrete actions, he added. China will push itself much further in its opening up way even though it has fulfilled the promises, Wang vowed, explaining that it will strive for a more balanced trade and boost trade facilitation by following the trend of worldâs development. It will substantially widen market access, create a more attractive environment for foreign investment, and encourage sound and rational outward investment, in committing itself to opening up wider and deeper to promote common development across the world, he said. It will work with other countries to build a human community of shared destiny characterized by mutual dependence and intertwined interests, the official added. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

China's Ministry of Commerce released a statement on Thursday, in which it, point-by-point, refuted the so-called blames mentioned in the Statement by the US Trade Representative on Section 301 Action unveiled on July 10. Over the years, China has given priority to and taken proactive measures to address the USâ concerns, but the US turned a blind eye to Chinaâs efforts, disregarded the multilateral trading system, and resorted to unilateral protectionist policies for sake of its own interests, the experts added. Placing great importance to its ties with the US, China has introduced a series of measures to improve bilateral trade relations and diffuse disputes, said Luo Yuze, director of the Research Department of Foreign Economic Relations at the State Councilâs Development Research Center. Luo added that China did so since it takes its relations with the US as one of its most important bilateral relationships. China has made clear-cut pledge that strong measures would be rolled out to expand its imports as unilateral export growth and foreign trade deficit has never been its appeal. At this year's annual meeting of the Boao Forum for Asia, China announced a slew of measures to further open up market and encourage exports, indicating its sincerity to improve trade relations with the US as well as other countries. China has been restrained when dealing with trade dispute with the US as it insists on not firing the first shot or proactively adding tariffs to retaliate, said Luo. The country also did a lot to address the USâ concerns over overcapacity, experts underlined. âChina and the US maintains a close trade relationship. As a developing country and late comer as well, China has been learning international rules to adapt itself to economic globalization,â said Zhou Mi, deputy director of the Institute of America and Oceania of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation with the Ministry of Commerce. But the US, where the 2008 global financial crisis started, dragged the world economy into a 10-year-long rebalance process and directly led to a sharp decrease of the demand and relative supply surplus, Zhou said. Against such backdrop, China has been endeavoring for a new balance with solutions like supply-side structural reform, he said, adding that during the G20 Hangzhou Summit in 2016, China reached a consensus with other stakeholders to establish the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity in order to address periodical fluctuations of overcapacity. In addition to the efforts, China quickens reform and opening up steps by substantially cutting tariffs on imported vehicles and other products and increasing imports of American agricultural and energy products. In stark contrast to Chinaâs concrete efforts is the USâ disrespect for the international trading rules and escalation of the trade war step by step. China and the US have held four rounds of negotiations. In the process, China, with a strong sense of responsibility and constructive attitude, put forward plans to expand imports of American agricultural and energy products, and worked on proposals of enlarging imports of US manufactured goods and services, said Li Yong from China Association of International Trade. âHowever, in reckless disregard of this sincerity, the US abruptly imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, breaking the consensus reached and shutting the door on negotiations. It is not China but the US that is irresponsible,â Li noted. China was forced to take counteractions, Li noted, stressing that it is a justified choice to defend the core interests of the nation and its people. The US has become so unreasonable in distorting facts, and also it is irresponsible for China if it does not react, he added. A retrospect of the escalation of US-China trade tensions will tell that it is the US who started every dispute without any respect for international trading rules. On April 3, the US administration published a proposed list of Chinese products worth around $50 billion subject to additional 25 percent tariffs, based on a so-called Section 301 investigation report. On April 27, the Office of the United States Trade Representative released the ""2018 Special 301 Report on Intellectual Property Rights"", unilaterally judging and criticizing the intellectual property rights in other countries. Then, on May 29, the White House announced that it would make public the list of Chinese products worth around $50 billion subject to additional 25 percent tariffs by June 15 and announce restrictions on Chinese investment in the US and export controls by June 30. On July 6, the White House announced 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese products, and five days later, Washington worsened the situation by announcing a tariff list of Chinese products worth $200 billion. The trade war was provoked by the US, and Chinaâs engagement in the war is for a peaceful resolution, which cannot be achieved either by stepping aside or by losing the war, said Chen Wenling, chief economist at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges. China has made major and sincere policy adjustments to ease the USâ concerns in trade deficit, and market access, especially the financial service sector, said Wang Xiaosong, professor with Renmin University of China. But showing no respect to the truth, the US groundlessly levied high tariffs on Chinese products in the disguise of reciprocal trading, hurting Chinaâs core interests, Wang added. Under the current background, China has to protest against trade bullying and hit back at the US with countermeasures, while upholding reform and opening up, the expert noted. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

China's Ministry of Commerce expressed solemn protest against the US announcement and said the Chinese government will, as always, ""be forced to take necessary countermeasures."" The latest tariff list shows the US has failed to subdue China with previous tariff threats and decides to ramp it up. It's unknown whether Washington means to indeed implement the list or simply to further extort China. In neither way will it subjugate China. The latest tariffs will undergo a review process and hearings on August 20-23. Washington will decide whether to implement the tariffs around August 30. In August the White House will be deciding whether to impose tariffs on another $16 billion in Chinese products. It is obstinate on the tariff. US extortion tricks, which are becoming more apparent, are diminishing in strength despite increasing in number. Chinese society is better aware of and fully prepared for whatever villain actions come out of the US. The Chinese government has been ready to take retaliatory measures whenever needed. While the previous list of tariffs targeted $50 billion worth of Chinese goods related to high-tech, the latest tariffs are directed against over 6,000 products that are mainly primary goods and agricultural produce. Washington once claimed to restrict the tariffs' impact to consumer goods. But as the conflicts escalate, it is unable to accurately control the range of impact. The listed $200 billion of Chinese products, which won't threaten US competitive sectors, can provide cheap and fine commodities for Americans and substantially enhance their living standards. A hit on these products only proves that the reasons that Washington used for launching the trade war are false. The US just wants to find fault with China. China will defeat the US trade infringement as long as it stays composed under pressure. The competition of major powers eventually lies in that of internal governance. US electric carmaker Tesla on Tuesday signed an agreement with Chinese authorities to build a factory in Shanghai, which suggests that China's opening up goes on unaffected by the trade war and is open to cooperation with companies from other countries, including the US. Chinese society is enraged by the US trade hegemony. Some export-oriented companies in China have suffered directly from the trade war and deserve the government's help to minimize the losses. The Chinese government can adjust economics and trade toward less dependence on the US. China is not alone in dealing with the US. The Ministry of Commerce said it will immediately lodge an additional complaint with the WTO over the unilateral acts of the US. Chinese people have become more confident in handling outside challenges. As long as China stays resolute, rational and calm, it will remain invincible against the US. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

China is a firm supporter of the multilateral trade system, said Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen at the seventh WTO review of Chinaâs trade policies and practices, which commenced in Geneva on July 11, 2018. Trade Policy Reviews are an exercise, mandated in the WTO agreement, in which the trade and related policies of all countries are examined and evaluated at regular intervals. WTO members expressed their appreciation that China has fulfilled its commitment to open up its market and comply with multilateral rules, making sure relevant domestic legislation and policies are in line with WTO rules. Wang noted in his keynote speech at the review that since the WTOâs last review of China in 2016, the country has adopted a series of measures for trade and investment liberation and facilitation. For example, China has been cutting import tax. By the end of 2017, the tax rate of more than 900 taxable items had been reduced, with the trade average tariff dropping to 2.4 percent. In addition, China has been expanding its market access for foreign investors. Wang explained that it has increased the allowance of foreign shareholding to 100 percent in its banking industry. Both China and the world have changed a lot over the past 40 years since Chinaâs reform and opening up. What stays unchanged is Chinaâs concept of continuous opening up and cooperation, working to achieve mutual benefit and win-win results with other countries, Wang noted. He stressed that China also brought important opportunities to world economic growth as well as tangible benefits to its trade and investment partners whilst pursuing domestic development. Over the past five years, China has been promoting construction of the Belt and Road Initiative and the development strategies of other countries since the initiative was put forward by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013. By the end of 2017, Chinese enterprises had set up 75 overseas economic and trade cooperation zones globally, paying over $1.6 billion to host countries and creating 220,000 local jobs. Wang pointed out that China will continue to support the multilateral trade system and respond to problems in the process of economic globalization together with other countries, to bring opportunities and benefits to the world. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

It is totally unacceptable for the US to publish a tariff list in a way that escalates tensions, the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement. ""To defend the core interests of the nation and its people, the Chinese government will, as always, be forced to impose necessary countermeasures,"" it said. The ministry gave no details of possible retaliation, but Beijing earlier promised both ""qualitative and quantitative"" comprehensive countermeasures. It also said it will add a new suit against the US before the WTO regarding the newly proposed tariffs. Also on Wednesday, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying described the US' latest move as ""trade hegemony and bullying"", saying China will have to respond to firmly safeguard its legitimate interests. China stands on the right side of history in defending multilateralism, Hua added. Their remarks came after the Office of the US Trade Representative announced on Tuesday a $200 billion list of Chinese goods for possible 10 percent tariffs. The items ranged from electronic components to cat food. The US claimed the tariffs were in response to Beijing's ""failure"" to change its policies and in retaliation for last week's US tariff hike by increasing duties on US goods. The spiraling conflict has prompted warnings it might chill global economic growth. Li Chenggang, assistant commerce minister, said additional tariffs will put tremendous pressure on global companies and consumers. He said China will not change its long-term commitment to improving the domestic business environment, opposing unilateral measures and supporting the multilateral trading system. The latest list of $200 billion in products to be subject to tariffs against China doubles down on a reckless strategy that will boomerang and harm US families and workers, according to David French, senior vice-president for government relations of the National Retail Federation in the US. ""Tariffs on such a broad scope of products make it inconceivable that American consumers will dodge this tax increase as prices of everyday products will be forced to rise,"" French said in a statement. The US is seeking public opinion regarding the latest proposed modification of tariffs on Chinese goods. The public comment period ends on Aug 30. Uncertainties may still exist about whether the whole list will finally take effect and what kinds of goods will be targeted, said Ma Jun, a member of the People's Bank of China's monetary policy committee. China is busy studying the impact of an escalating trade war on affected companies and industries, and might consider adopting new measures to minimize negative impacts, according to Ma. More global experts on trade are expressing serious concerns on the latest protectionist tariffs introduced by the US against China, the European Union, Mexico and Canada. Such tariffs, they say, severely affect the global supply chain and put an extra burden on multinationals, including US companies sourcing components from the rest of the world. ""With regret from many (countries) around the world, the US has departed from the principle of free trade and has embarked on a full-blown trade war,"" said Christopher Bovis, a professor of international business law at the University of Hull in England. ""The US actions threaten to unseat global supply chain arrangements and destroy existing trade partnerships that have promoted economic growth and employment in many parts of the world."" Hans Uszkoreit, an academician with the European Academy of Sciences, said against the backdrop of China-US trade tensions, economic, scientific and technological cooperation between China and the European Union are expected to be put on a fast track. Uszkoreit expected that the trade spat can, to some extent, ""bring China (and the) EU closer"", as the two already share long historical links and manufacturing connections. On July 6, US tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, including medical devices and airplane parts, took effect. Douglas Morton, head of Asia research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, contended that the tariffs, which also impact exchange rates, will create challenges for multinationals that take out loans in one market to pay for their expansion in another. Airlines and property companies are also especially vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations, Morton added. Zhao Huanxin in Washington and Ren Xiaojin in Beijing contributed to this story. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The so called âtrade imbalanceâ theory is one of them. However, itâs often said that those who speak well are no better than those who listen intently. The same can be said for international trade, which is about mutual exchange and willingness. Both sides of a trade agreement will surely discontinue unless there are profits or beneficial domestic results. Therefore, with so many years of trade already passing by, why has America only just become obsessed with a so called trade imbalance? More paradoxically, as one of the strongest global superpowers, how has America seemingly become the biggest victim of such an imbalance? Could it be that the former occupants of the White House were happy to sell their countryâs interests, or were too weak to argue with their trade partners? The White House holds two main arguments for why international trade is currently imbalanced. Firstly, the scale of Americaâs trade deficit with other countries is too large, to such a degree that they have to be dealt with immediately. Secondly, the U.S. suggests that trade partners do not treat the country fairly in terms of policy, which in turn makes U.S. economy, industry and employment all suffer. We should use figures and facts when talking about trade, but unfortunately the American calculator seems to get it wrong when dealing with statistics. Taking Sino-U.S. trade as an example, according to a working group of experts from Chinese and American governments, U.S. statistics regarding the country's trade deficit with China have been overestimated by 20 percent. More unconvincingly, the trade statistics quoted by the U.S. government only include commodity trade and do not reflect trade in services. However, the U.S. service sector accounts for over 70 percent of its GDP. How has the country lost such a large sum when calculating their trade accounts? It seems that if it were calculated, the so called âtrade imbalance theoryâ would be even more unsustainable. The U.S. is unwilling to discuss commodity and service trade together, but even when it comes to commodity trade itself, the U.S. should take a closer look at how it has arrived at its current situation. When it comes to importing goods, the U.S. buys without hesitation, however when it comes to exporting its own products, the country is not nearly as willing. If this kind of mentality continues then the trade deficit will continue to expand, and thereâs no doubt as to why. The percentage of Chinese current account surplus in its GDP has fallen dramatically over the last decade, from 9.9 percent in 2007 to 1.4 percent in 2017. However, itâs telling that Chinaâs trade surplus with America continues to rise. Business is accompanied by figures, and these figures are always changing. Even though certain statistics donât look good for America, it must be clarified that trade deficit is not equal to interest deficit. The Research Report on China-U.S. Economic and Trade Relations released by the Ministry of Commerce, Peopleâs Republic of China (MOFCOM) shows that in the global value chain, trade surplus is reflected in China, while interest surplus is reflected in America. According to statistics, 57 percent of Chinaâs commodity trade surplus came from foreign companies last year, 59 percent of which came from processing trade. China only earns a small amount in processing fees, while the U.S earns a big profit from design, parts supply and marketing. In the China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation, America also imports a large number of low-cost labor-intensive products from China, which truly benefits American consumers and also helps the U.S. curb domestic inflation. Not actively pursuing a surplus has always been a trade principle of China. To keep up with the growing demands of its people and high-quality development of its economy, China is actively expanding its imports. China voluntarily cut tariffs for daily consumer goods on July 1, involving 1,449 taxable items with an average decrease of 55.9 percent. Muddled accounts are not always calculated by the confused, but are often created by the smart, Americaâs âtrade imbalanceâ being the perfect example. From advocating âfree tradeâ to âfair trade,â the U.S. has only one purpose, to push through its âAmerica firstâ agenda, making the whole world pay the bill for its world domination. According to Americaâs so called âfair tradeâ assertion, every country is required to keep a complete consistency with America in regards to the tariff of specific products and the market access of all industries, creating absolute equivalence. In the history of international trade, when and among which countries does this absolute equivalence and opening-up exist? Tariff levels and degrees of opening-up are always closely related to a countryâs stage of development, endowment of resources and industrial competitiveness. Americaâs so called fair trade actually denies the different stages of development, which will bring greater impact to the economy and industries of developing countries, which in turn is sure to lead to greater inequality. Unilateral protectionism is like closing yourself in a dark room. Although you have escaped the wind and rain, you have also been isolated from sunshine and air. What is done about international trade can only be negotiated by all countries involved, leading to mutually beneficial and win-win results. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

China and the United States will inevitably both pay a price as they enter the biggest trade war in the history of the global economy. The United States' additional tariff on 34 billion U.S. dollars worth of Chinese imports will have an impact on some Chinese enterprises. It will also impact on the lives of their employees. China's government anticipated this, which is why it didn't want to see a trade war start. But now that it has, China will fight it to the bitter end. On Monday evening, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce announced new policies that aim to relieve the impact of China-U.S. trade frictions. The policies include continuously evaluating the impact on te dispute on different kinds of companies; using the income raised by China's countermeasure tariffs to relieve the impact on affected companies and their employees; encourage companies to restructure their imports; and, step up the implementation of the the State Council guidelines on thr effective use of foreign investment. Taken together, these measures demonstrate China's strong capabilities in risk control and underlines its determination when it comes to fighting the trade war. Of course, China will face losses. And although the losses may be minor relative to China's economy as a whole, it will likely be a big blow to some individual enterprises. But China's government has said that it will try its best to limit the negative consequences. For example, evaluating the impact of the dispute on different companies, and using tariff income to offer relief to the affected companies and their employees, are direct and effective ways to help enterprises and its employees deal with their losses. Encouraging companies to restructure their imports helps to support their long-term development by diversifying their trade partners and in doing so splitting the risks. And China's Securities Regulatory Commission announced on Sunday that it would allow more foreigners to trade A-shares, in a move to further open capital markets and in doing so further prepare the economy for the trade war against the United States. As the trade war as just started, there are still many uncertainties, and China should be ready to change its countermeasures in a timely manner, so that these countermeasures can continue to effectively minimize loses. Can China really afford the cost of the trade war? It has the world's broadest domestic economy, and enjoys a huge consumer market with 1.4 billion people. This means that China's economy can absorb blows even in the hardest of times. Meanwhile, 91 percent of China's economic growth derives from domestic demand, and 60 percent of it is driven by consumption. Its innovation-driven development brings resilience to its economy. And its opening up policy is continuing to spur growth: The 2018 Business Climate Survey recently released by the American Chamber of Commerce in China has revealed that 74 percent of its members plan to expand investment in China, the highest level of planned expansion in recent years. The United States has long been mulling over launching a trade war not only so it can reduce its trade deficit, but also so that it could hamper the development of China's high-tech sector at its roots. In doing so it has even attempted to force structural reform on China's economy to divert the path of the country's development. And so, the trade war with America is a fight for China's destiny. Its people and government are willing to make sacrifices, overcome difficulties, and make a concerted effort to safeguard the country's sustainable economic development. That's why China can be confident as it heads into battle. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

""BMW China will not be able to completely absorb the higher tariffs for cars imported from the U.S.,"" a spokesperson of the DAX-listed company told the press in Munich. ""At the moment we are calculating necessary price increases in this context,"" the official added. Trade tensions between the United States and China, the world's top two economies, have escalated since Friday, when the United States began imposing a 25-percent additional tariff on Chinese products worth 34 billion U.S. dollars. China was forced to retaliate. Its customs authority announcing that additional tariffs for some imports from the United States worth the same amount, including agricultural products, vehicles and aquatic products, took effect on the same day. BMW operates its largest car assembly line in Spartanburg in the U.S. state of South Carolina, from where it has traditionally exported the SUV models X3 and X6 to China and other destinations across the world. In May, the German company opened a new factory in Shenyang, China. The factory has already taken over the production of the X3 for the Chinese market from the Spartanburg site in a first major supply-chain shift at BMW in reaction to the trade war launched by the U.S. administration. BMW is not the first German carmaker for whom the implementation of Trump's ""America First"" doctrine has begun to create financial and logistical issues. In June, Stuttgart-based Daimler lowered its earnings forecast for 2018 as a result of the escalating trade frictions. In a statement to investors, Daimler emphasized that it would not be able to fully offset the effects of the spiralling trade confrontation through the reallocation of vehicles to other markets. The SUV assembly line operated by Daimler's flagship brand Mercedes-Benz in Vance, Alabama, in particular was likely to be hit as sales in the important Chinese market fell. Volkswagen and BMW retained their leading positions in the global automotive industry during the first quarter of 2018, according to a study by the accounting firm Ernst & Young. Wolfsburg-based Volkswagen topped the international list in terms of total sales and revenue, while BMW achieved the first place for profitability. According to the study, buoyant business in China was once again a key driver of growth for the German carmakers. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Given China's additional tariffs on some US imports and its lowering of tariffs on imports from other countries, the competitiveness of US goods in the Chinese market will weaken as their prices rise, Chen Fengying, an expert at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Monday. The comment came after French luxury goods firm Hermes announced a price drop for some of its products in China starting from July 1, the same day a tariff reduction scheme rolled out by the Chinese government took effect. Similar steps were taken by France-based LVMH, which reduced prices by between 300 yuan ($45.3) and 1,500 yuan, and Gucci, which is lowering the prices for its entire portfolio by an average of 5 percent, according to the National Business Daily. The three companies all said the reason for the price cut is the Chinese government's tariff policy. Rise in tension The move came as trade tension between China and the US entered a new stage on Friday, with both countries slapping heavy tariffs on each other's goods. Yang Qingshan, executive president at the China Brand Strategy Association, told the Global Times on Monday that the price cut by European brands will enlarge their consumer base and draw customers away from US luxury brands such as handbag maker Tapestry Inc, formerly known as Coach. Experts also noted that daily consumer goods from the US are facing rising competition from other countries, especially as many Chinese people naturally prefer Asian goods in various sectors ranging from cars and clothes to food and gadgets. China has placed a reciprocal tariff of 25 percent on US auto imports, forcing Tesla to raise its price in the Chinese mainland by almost 20 percent, while European brands such as Volvo are lowering the prices of their imported cars. At one dealership in Beijing, the previously strong sales of Tesla vehicles appeared to have cooled down over the weekend, with a big drop in the number of consumers eyeing the cars. ""It will be an opportunity for companies in other countries - for instance Europe - that have coveted the Chinese market for a long time,"" Chen said. Even before the trade row, US products like Pampers, Colgate toothpaste and Mead Johnson infant formula had seen their market share drop by around 10 percentage points in the past five years, Reuters reported in June, citing data from Bain and Kantar based on a survey of 40,000 urban households. Now, in addition to price and competitiveness, consumer sentiment is also coming into play. ""If the goods could only be purchased from the US, then I could tolerate the higher price; but if there are substitutes, I would prefer goods made by other countries as I feel angry about the US' unreasonable stance,"" a Beijing-based white-collar worker surnamed Liu told the Global Times.

It not only hampers China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation, but also brings great uncertainty to the global economy. âThe U.S.âs goal of reducing trade deficits by tariff measures will by and large failâ, âSkirting WTO rules, the U.S.âs tariff measures will harm the rule-based international trading system,â the trade war initiated by Washington has been widely criticized by international media for its negative consequences. The foundation for economic and trade cooperation is complementariness, not a zero-sum mentality. China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation is a vivid example of the theory that an open product, service and market will drive economic growth and promote the prosperity of a country. As the worldâs largest developing and developed country, China and the U.S. are different in terms of their development, economic structure and resources. These differences formed a highly complementary relationship that became a strong engine for cooperation. A community of shared interests featuring deep integration and independence has been built by combining the American strengths in creating high-added value, research and development with Chinaâs advantages in low-cost production and assembly. The reality has proven that cooperation achieves win-win results while confrontation leads to lose-lose situations. In 2017, China-U.S. trade volume reached $583.7 billion, which was 233 times the figure in 1979 when the two countries established diplomatic relations. A report released by the U.S. Business Council showed that U.S. exports to China have supported at least one million American jobs. The experience of international trade has proven that unilateral protectionism is a game that neither helps solve structural problems of the initiator nor benefits global consumers. The tough tariff measures against Chinese goods will only see more U.S. enterprises lose the Chinese market and miss opportunities brought about by a new round of reform and opening up in China. Economic and trade cooperation propels common prosperity, not unbalanced development. China-U.S. cooperation is an important part of economic globalization. In 2017, the trading volume of commodities and services from China and the U.S. accounted for 10.4 percent and 11.4 percent of the worldâs total, respectively. Presently, stable investment and trade are especially needed for global economic recovery. The trade protectionism of the U.S. is bound to disturb international trade order and hinder economic globalization. The trend of globalization means that the interests of countries are interrelated; therefore, building a community of shared destiny is necessary in today's world. As the largest developed economy in the world, the U.S. is obliged to conform to the times and adopt a win-win attitude. The opposite mentality is outdated, as countries are constantly moving forward and thus only a win-win concept can guarantee the sustainable development of all economies. All living things can be nourished without injuring one another, while all roads are able to run parallel without interfering with one another. The zero-sum mentality, which puts U.S. interests above all others, is an outdated and backward way of thinking that should be abandoned. The world is large enough to allow all countries to develop and prosper. Only by casting the zero-sum mind aside can the U.S. build better trade with other countries, bring more welfare to the people and create more development dividends. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

On July 3, U.S. president Donald Trump said the U.S. is the best place to do business, adding that he is working on introducing other motorcycle companies to his country, without disclosing how. Harley-Davidson is not the only U.S. company attempting to avoid the protectionist trade policy. Mid Continent Nail Corp has also said it may have to suspend its operations or move them to Mexico if the Trump Administration fails to offer tariff exemptions on steel products. Mid Continent Nail Corp is reported to have already laid off 10 percent of its staff because it couldnât afford the additional costs incurred when importing raw materials from its mother company in Mexico. Trade protectionism leads to rising tariffs on raw materials that companies in the U.S. need for production, increasing costs and therefore making U.S. products less competitive domestically. Also, because of the increasing tariffs, countries affected by trade protectionism will have to substantially raise prices of U.S. products in their own market, which will consequently reduce competitiveness of American goods on an international scale. Instead of protecting enterprises, trade protectionism has become an obstacle that damages America's business environment. It has forced U.S. companies to move their businesses out of the country, which will cause workers to lose their jobs. According to European media, the Harley Davidson case is a warning to the outdated trade protectionism of the U.S. The trade war, unilaterally started by the Trump Administration, is a lose-lose battle. In the 1930s, the U.S. government started a trade war by implementing the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. Due to the trade war, the import volume of the country fell by more than 60 percent, and the unemployment rate almost quadrupled. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Moreover, it will trigger market turmoil and hamper global economic recovery, Lu told a daily news briefing. ""The move will deal a blow to many multinationals, enterprises and ordinary consumers worldwide, while various industries and the public of the United States have realized that they themselves will also suffer,"" said the spokesperson.

Any unilateral pressure is futile, and no one should be delusional, he added. ""It is granted for China to fight back when its legitimate rights are undermined,"" Lu said.

The 25-percent additional tariffs slapped on Chinese products worth $34 billion took effect on Friday. The US move pushed China to fight back, and later on Friday it levied additional tariffs on 545 items of US goods with around the same value, including vehicles and agricultural and aquatic products. Those tariffs also took effect on Friday. It was the first tangible action that China has taken in the trade tension between the two countries after the US kept provoking a trade war for months, not only with China but also with the global supply and value chain. The US has ignited the largest trade war in economic history, as additional tariffs on Chinese goods violate World Trade Organization rules and represent a typical ""trade bully"", posing a grave threat to the global industrial value chain, according to a statement by the Ministry of Commerce. The ministry also said in a statement later on Friday that China has lodged a tariff case against the US with the WTO. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the US action will hamper global economic recovery and trigger global market turmoil, dealing a blow to many multinationals, small and medium-sized enterprises and ordinary consumers. Lu said the unilateral activities conducted by the US government forced China to counterattack to defend its core national interests and the interests of its people. As well as the additional duties on $34 billion of Chinese products, additional tariffs on another group of $16 billion in Chinese goods will undergo further review in a public notice and comment process in the US. The US tariffs this time target Chinese goods from a range of sectors including aerospace, information technology, auto parts and medical instruments. Ma Jun, a member of the People's Bank of China's monetary policy committee, said the planned US tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods is estimated to cut China's GDP growth by 0.2 percentage point, but its overall impact will be limited. ""The US tariff plan has been discussed by the market for more than two months. The (negative) impact toward the economy, industries and companies has been priced in at current levels,"" he said. Li Daokui, an economist at Tsinghua University, said the real risk of a trade war is that it could cause global free trade flows to deteriorate and set off a chain reaction hindering economic globalization. Li said industries like consumer goods, electronics and manufacturing would be mostly affected in China, but ""the impacts are controllable"". Moreover, the tariff increase on Chinese goods will eventually be passed on to US customers who have more reliance on China-made products, Li added. ""As Chinese companies have certain pricing power in these products exported to the US market, US consumers might have a hard time finding alternatives,"" Li said. The trade tension has already caused trouble for businesses in both countries. The cargo ship Peak Pegasus, carrying US soybeans, failed to reach its destination port in northern China in a race to beat a 25 percent tariff, according to foreign media. Liu Wei, the president of Renmin University of China and another member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, told China Daily that against the backdrop of a trade war, the country's monetary policy will remain prudent and neutral, along with continual structural deleveraging, targeting to ensure adequate liquidity and efforts to stabilize economic growth and prevent external shocks. ""We have sufficient, diversified and flexible monetary policy tools to achieve the annual growth targets, including the GDP growth rate and inflation level and to control the unemployment rate,"" said Liu. ""China's growth stabilization is important for the whole world, given its GDP has already accounted for nearly 15 percent of the global economy."" Sun Jianzhong, vice-president of Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group Inc, a major Chinese construction machinery manufacturer based in Jiangsu province, said the company currently is talking with its dealers in the US to raise prices there on a number of its products, including cranes, to deal with the new tariff situation.

This super power has become arrogant enough to resort to a trade war, seemingly the only tool in its policy kit, ignoring how U.S. enterprises and soybean producers will be affected and whether the tariff measures may bring trouble to the country itself. The U.S. is beginning to put up high walls against globalization and integrated markets, but never reflects on why it remains the only one having problems while the global economy and other countries are all benefiting from globalization. It seems that the U.S. is ignoring its own tremendous advancements due to globalization, attempting to gain greater profits by launching deglobalization, which indicates its selfish mindset of hegemony that leaves the interests of other countries behind. The United States wrongly believes that domestic economic problems have resulted due to a trade deficit in the U.S. because of China. However, the real situation is that the trade deficit is rooted in shortage of national savings, overconsumption and its global industry chain layout. The U.S. has exploited substantial tangible benefits from its business in China, but has still blamed China for the trade deficit. Such confrontation displays a mentality reminiscent of the cold-war era. Tactics that go against peaceful development would be a disaster for the whole world, especially developing countries, and the U.S. is sure to also suffer. Trump appoints âDeath by Chinaâ author to lead new U.S. trade council It's been said that the theoretical ""source of policy"" has come from economist Peter Navarro's book ""Death by China"", released in 2011. Navarro now leads the National Trade Council (NTC) with the Trump administration, recently writing a report that replays points from his writing in 2011. He blames China for the loss of American jobs, advises people to boycott made-in-China products and has hyped up the âChina threatâ. Navarroâs logic is not approved by mainstream western media and scholars. The China Threat Theory, which is unfounded and unsubstantiated, looks more like a political tool, said economist Dan Steinbock from the U.S.âs India, China and America Institute. The Los Angeles Times also noted that Navarroâs documentary âDeath By Chinaâ is drowned out by xenophobic hysteria and exaggerations. This alarmist theory, so full of loopholes, now provides support for todayâs American economic policy toward China, but in the future, it will bring destructive effects to globalization and the global trade order, and is sure to make the U.S. victim to its own actions. China doesnât want a trade war, but as a country thriving amid bitter struggles, the nation is not afraid of fighting one. Negotiations are suggested, but if the trade war breaks out, China will take necessary countermeasures to the latest U.S. tariffs. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, recently informed Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW during a secret meeting in Berlin that he had been tasked by Trump with finding a solution to the swelling trade conflict between the United States and EU. Towards this end, Washington was willing to consider mutual tariff elimination in automotive trade and reductions of non-tariff barriers in the industry. Industry circles confirmed to Xinhua on Thursday that the high-level meeting had taken place but that ""no deal"" had been made yet. The meeting in Berlin was described as a ""continuation of a dialogue"" that had already started at the annual meeting of the German car association (VDA) on June 6. Germany's federal government was made aware of the meeting and the proposals revealed there by Grenell in advance. Chancellor Angela Merkel and leading car makers in the country have repeatedly called for mutual tariff reductions as a means to repair strained transatlantic ties and help improve the export competitiveness of the U.S. economy. However, any elimination of trade barriers in the automotive sector would have to take place in the framework of a wider agreement on U.S.-EU industrial cooperation under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. According to the Handelsblatt report, during the talks at the U.S. embassy in Berlin, Grenell urged the attendant car makers and automotive parts suppliers to seize the ""momentum"" to escape the global protectionist spiral unleashed by the ""America First"" doctrine of Trump. Earlier, Washington imposed punitive tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the EU and threatened to double-down with steep new duties on the bloc's vehicle exports to the United States. The proposal delivered by Grenell consequently marked a significant and surprising shift in tone from the White House which was widely seen in Germany as offering a potential way out of the current impasse between Washington and Brussels on trade. The share prices of German car makers and automotive suppliers listed on the DAX stock exchange rose significantly on Thursday in response to the report. Any EU agreement to mutual tariff reductions in the automotive industry with the United States would require consensus among the bloc's 27 members. In spite of optimistic reactions in the German automotive industry, however, such a feat could prove difficult to achieve, given Trump's previously erratic foreign policies and abrupt abandonment of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) following protracted U.S.-EU negotiations. French President Emmanuel Macron, in particular, has criticized the apparent disdain demonstrated by Trump in multilateral cooperation, as witnessed with regards to the Paris climate agreement, Iran nuclear deal, and U.S. steel tariffs. Rather than offering the United States a new industrial agreement at this point, he consequently called for the EU to remain firm in its unified opposition to unilateral policies and protectionism. In May, EU heads of state already made an official proposal to Trump to enter into discussions over a comprehensive industrial tariff reduction agreement on the pre-condition that the bloc would be permanently excluded from U.S. steel and import tariffs. Trump rejected the offer and subsequently added insult to injury by announcing via Twitter that he was backing out of a hard-won joint G7 resolution to pursue mutual tariff reduction. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is scheduled to travel to the United States in late July for an official meeting with Trump. The still-unresolved trade conflict between Brussels and Washington will hereby once again form the focal point of transatlantic discussions. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods are scheduled to take effect at 12:01 am on Friday in Washington â 12:01 pm in Beijing â the US Trade Representative confirmed in an email on Thursday, Bloomberg News reported. Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said on Thursday that about 59 percent of the $34 billion in Chinese goods are produced by foreign-invested enterprises in China. ""If the list takes effect on July 6, the US will actually impose tariffs on both Chinese and foreign companies, including US ones,"" Gao said. ""The US measures will essentially damage the global supply and value chains."" China's General Administration of Customs also announced that China will levy tariffs on US goods immediately after the US tariffs are in force. Their comments came a day before the US planned to impose 25 percent tariffs on Chinese products on Friday. China's financial system is stable, with the systemic risk under control thanks to the steady growth of social financing and strengthened profitability in listed companies in the first half of this year, Guo Shuqing, Party secretary of the People's Bank of China, the central bank, and chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, said in a Thursday interview with the bank's newspaper, Financial News. ""The country's economic foundation determines that it is unlikely the Chinese yuan will depreciate substantially,"" he said in reply to a question about the Sino-US trade tensions' impacts on the global financial system. ""As a gradually internationalized reserve currency, the yuan will be stronger in the future. It has been proven that some international speculators' short sales of yuan to seek exorbitant profits failed due to misreading the situation,"" Guo said. The escalating trade friction between the world's two largest economies has left many worried about a full-blown trade war that can chill the global economy. China has said it will not ""fire the first shot"" in a trade battle with the US. ""However, if the US goes ahead with the tariff hike, China will be forced to fight back to defend the core interests of the nation and the interests of the people,"" Gao said. Gao reiterated that China will not bow down in the face of threats and blackmail, and it will not veer from its determination to safeguard free trade and the multilateral system. China's foreign trade is expected to remain stable in the second half of this year, thanks to the country's new policies to upgrade the quality of its shipments, cultivate new business modes and further diversify sales channels in emerging markets, Gao said. China is not the one to provoke friction, which could escalate into a trade war, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Thursday. ""A trade war will do no good to any country, but harm the interests of industries and consumers,"" Geng said at a news briefing. Experts said the stance of US President Donald Trump's administration in launching the trade war has challenged the world order in a way unseen before. ""We will have no other choice but to raise the price of our products in the US markets as a result of the tariff levied by the Trump administration,"" said Qi Jun, president of Beijing-based China Construction Machinery Association. China shipped $2.4 billion worth of construction machinery, including excavators, bulldozers, pipe-layers and road rollers, to the US market in 2017, accounting for 10 percent of the country's total export volume in this area, the association said. The Trump administration's decision to levy tariffs against China will deal a blow to the hard work and efforts taken by China and many other countries amid the slow and fragile global economic recovery, said Chen Wenling, chief economist at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges. She said the US government's strategy totally disregards World Trade Organization rules, as it arbitrarily imposes tariffs on other countries based on its domestic laws and expands conflicts by way of intimidation and retaliation. Trade barriers being erected by major economies could damage the global economic recovery, the WTO said on Wednesday in a report on trade restrictions among G20 nations. WTO Director General RoÂ­berto Azevedo said in a statement that the continued escalation poses a serious threat to growth and recovery in all countries, and the organization is beginning to see this reflected in some forward-looking indicators. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The ministryâs comments came as certain foreign media, citing anonymous sources, said Chinaâs tariffs on $34 billion of US goods would take effect from the beginning of the day on Friday. Given the 12-hour time difference, that would have put its implementation ahead of Washingtonâs. âThe Chinese government has stated its position many times. We absolutely will not fire the first shot and will not implement tariff measures ahead of the US doing so,â the Ministry said. The trade spat between the worldâs two largest economies has been in the spotlight for about three months, since US President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum in March threatening tariffs on Chinese imports. The US said it would add tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports on July 6. China was forced to respond in kind. âA major global tariff shock would have adverse supply side impacts, raising costs for importers and disrupting supply chains, while reducing consumersâ real wages,â said US credit rating agency Fitch Ratings in a Wednesday report. Li Yong, a senior fellow with the China Association of International Trade, said the unilateral actions of the Trump administration are shortsighted and counterproductive. âThey go against both global interests and the long-term interests of the two countries involved. The consequences of these actions might not be what the White House expects, and in the end, they will only serve to hurt the US itself,â Li said. Fitch Ratingsâ report says the global multiplier effect of lower US imports could be significant, and US outward foreign direct investment would probably fall. Along with weaker confidence and lower investment, a global tariff shock would also hit job creation. Zhu Feng, dean of the Institute of International Relations of Nanjing University, said: âIt is time for the worldâs major economies to strengthen cooperation and stand up to Trumpâs âAmerica Firstâ strategy.

The customs clearance time has been reduced to less than 2 hours in several major Chinese cities including Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. ""We now guarantee our lobsters fresh and alive when they arrive on Chinese customers' doorsteps. If not, they can reject the package on site,"" said Leo Liu, general manager of 50N Natural Ecology Group Ltd, a Canadian company. The tariff cut can make the company's products more competitive in China, said Liu. Currently, few Canadian aquatic products and food enterprises have made China their major export market, as their traditional export markets are in America and Europe. Liu's company has opened online shops on Chinese leading e-commerce platforms, but sales volume in China only accounts for 5 percent of the company's sales. ""Canada's food trade with China is mainly grain, oil and other commodities. With China's import tariff cuts, we are selling more consumer products to China to catch up with the country's upgraded consumption habits,"" said Leo. Food traders are preparing for increasing iced imports of fresh and frozen food to the China market. Ye Zi, chief business officer of HM (Shanghai) Trade Co. Ltd., said the company has started to import frozen aquatic products from Japan for the first time. ""Frozen aquatic products have a shelf life of eight months. As the whole customs clearance process is limited to two weeks, it is now possible to sell imported frozen aquatic products in China,"" said Ye. Milk produced by New Zealand brand Theland can land in Shanghai's supermarkets and China's e-commerce platforms in roughly 72 hours after production and bottling near Auckland. The process used to take five days, said Sheng Wenhao, board chair of Theland New Cloud Digimart, which owns the brand. He said trade facilitation has made it possible to sell imported pasteurized milk in China, which has a shelf life of no more than 15 days. Earlier this year, the Shanghai Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau and the government of Changning District, home to the city's biggest Japanese and Korean communities, launched a trial scheme to speed up import inspection. Theland and four other brands, rated by municipal regulators as having reliable quality and good reputations, have entered the scheme's list for enjoying a ""fast track"" import quarantine and inspection. The 8-day customs clearance time of Theland milk has been reduced by more than half since then. Yang Dongsheng, head of Changning's commerce commission, said during the trial, the inspection and quarantine department has changed the work mode to carry out the import supervision procedures beforehand and afterwards. ""We start the quality inspection in the country of origin, and implement random checks after the imports arrive in China,"" Yang explained. Chocolate, as an imported product that has witnessed China's opening up and consumption upgrading, also reflects changes during this round of trade facilitation. Shanghai Maxmile International Trade Company is the general agent of several famous chocolate brands including Guylian in China. Wei Wenzhong, general manager of the company, told Xinhua that Chinese customers now have more diversified demands for flavor, locality and roasting methods of chocolates. He said Shea butter, while popular around the world, is still new to Chinese consumers. Chocolates with shea butter ingredients used to be blocked in China because shea butter did not have a HS (Harmonized System) code, which is an internationally standardized system of names and numbers to classify traded products. ""Last month, shea butter got its official HS code, and Chinese customers will be able to taste chocolates with shea butter soon,"" said Wei. ""More food and ingredients will be added to HS. Our new products such as goldberry chocolate will also enter the Chinese market soon."" The company, and many others, have benefitted from the Shanghai government's accelerated work on HS authentication. With Shanghai scheduled to host the first China International Import Expo (CIIE) in November, the municipal government has sped up removing restrictions and delays brought by HS codes. ""Shanghai encourages new and innovative products. We have implemented pre-inspection policies for market debuts of new products, which will enable a speedy passage through customs upon arrival. The new measures can allow new products to be sold here even without a proper classification momentarily,"" said Kong Fu'an, head of Business and Trading Office of the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Commerce. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Even after the United States announced it would raise tariffs on its steel and aluminum imports in March this year, there were hopes that negotiations might help stall the additional tariffs. Unfortunately, such hopes didn't materialize. US trade actions have begun evoking retaliatory actions from various economies. And a full-blown trade war now seems all but imminent. Countries are free to choose the way they treat their imports. The World Trade Organization has pursued a multilateral program of phased tariff liberalization by urging its members to treat each other as MFNs (most favored nations) and imposing same tariffs on identical imports from all members. However, the WTO members have had the scope of ""binding"" their tariffs. In other words, all WTO members are allowed to raise their tariffs up to a ceiling that they have committed to. They are also allowed to react to sudden surges in imports by raising tariffs as ""safeguards"". Despite all these protections, it is not clear why the US decided to unilaterally raise tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Any concerns by the US in this regard could well have been addressed within the WTO's rules. Thus the US actions have set off a dangerous precedent that has the potential of undermining the fundamentals of modern trade. The most worrying part of the US tariffs is the equation of economic security to national security. Section 232 investigations under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 against steel and aluminum imports, and further on automobiles, parts and components, suggest these imports are threatening US national security. It is not clear how the import of foreign cars from Mexico and other countriesï¼assembled by US manufacturers in those locationsï¼is hurting US national interests. The fact is, US producers are benefiting as are the consumers using those cars. The logic extends to a large number of other imports that US businesses are using at various points of the supply chain and US consumers are benefiting from cheap imports. The logic of national security, arguably, is connected to the damage imports inflict on domestic industries and the ""dependence"" of the US economy on critical imports. Whether or not this is justified is a different question. But the problem is, if other countries decide to follow the US example and start raising tariffs on national security grounds, global trade will drop to a trickle. That the US has not bothered to consult the WTO before taking such trade actions has not stopped other countries from complaining against the US at the WTO. For the US, though, unfavorable decisions at the WTO might not mean much. The Donald Trump administration's actions have made it clear that the US considers trade as a bilateral relation and would address it accordingly. Indeed, the sanctity of the WTO has never been as seriously challenged as it is by the US now. Again, this sets a precedent for a dangerous trend. If more and more countries follow the US and begin sidestepping the WTO, multilateral trade rules would become irrelevant. The US does not appear to be in a mood to change its position. As it keeps slapping more and more tariffs on a range of imports from China and various other countries, business relocation is an obvious outcome. Already, US companies like Harley-Davidson have announced or are planning to move part of their operations to other countries to circumvent the retaliatory tariffs imposed by the European Union on US imports, including cars and motorbikes. Such possibilities are manifold as businesses try to work out the impact of multiple tariffs that are coming up on all sides. Within a few years, geographical decentralization of assembling operations in many industries might be very different from what they are now. From an overall perspective, the trade disputes, now confined to tariffs, between the US and the rest of the world might become wider by including non-tariff barriers and spreading to other countries. This most unfortunate outcome might mean the end of the work that has been done for more than three decades in freeing up trade by removing barriers. More important, it would turn around history to a point where work on trade would have to begin from where it began many years ago. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

[Photo by Ren Haixia/For China Daily] China is working to reduce the prices of cancer drugs and the financial burden on patients, according to health officials Saturday. Prices of cancer drugs will be reduced through centralized negotiations and procurement, Zeng Yixin, vice director of the National Health Commission, said at a press conference. According to Chen Jinfu, head of the medical insurance department of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, last year the government reached agreements with pharmaceutical enterprises on the prices of 36 cancer medicines on the medical insurance list. Prices of these drugs have been marked down by 44 percent on average, Chen said. Stressing a patient-centered approach in negotiations, the official also noted that market competition is also needed. The government will work to include more antineoplastic drugs into the country's catalogue of medical insurance reimbursement, which already incorporates most of the relevant drugs. Moreover, efforts have been made in accelerating the review and approval procedures for new medicines, reducing circulation costs and improving diagnosis to reduce the burden on patients and their families, Zeng said. The average approval time for imported drugs has been significantly shortened, and the customs clearance procedures streamlined, said Li Jinju, an official with China Food and Drug Administration. The Ministry of Finance announced Monday that China will exempt 28 drugs from import tariffs, including all cancer drugs from May 1, as part of wider opening of the market. Admitting that the tariff cut may challenge China's domestic pharmaceutical industry, Liu Dengfeng of the health commission expressed confidence in tackling it. China's medical research and development has progressed in recent years with the talent pool getting stronger and innovation booming, he said."

China acceded to the WTO in 2001. The document noted that this was a milestone in China's integration into economic globalization, marking a new historic stage of reform and opening-up. Since its accession to the WTO, China has been a strong advocate for free trade. The documents provide a large number of evidence and data to show what China has done to substantively reduce import tariff, liberalize the right to trade, fulfill commitments on trade in services, the protection of intellectual property rights and transparency. By 2010, China had fulfilled all of its tariff reduction commitments, according to the paper.

These will definitely provide plenty business opportunities for foreign company.

In the white paper, titled China and the World Trade Organization, the government reiterated that it pursues a mutually beneficial trade strategy and that China will continue to open up in ""a more comprehensive, profound and diversified way"". Wang Shouwen, vice-minister of commerce, said China has been a key engine for world economic recovery and growth since 2002, contributing on average nearly 30 percent annually of global economic growth. He said China's reform and opening-up campaign over the past 40 years has far more than fulfilled its commitments for WTO access, and it has become a major trading partner of more than 120 countries and regions. The documents provide ample examples and data showing what China has done to observe and uphold WTO rules. They fully demonstrate support for a multilateral trading system that is open, transparent, inclusive and nondiscriminatory. The white paper shows China has been an active participant, strong supporter of and major contributor to the multilateral trading system. ""China has not only honored its WTO entry commitments, but also pushed itself to go much further in the scope and depth of opening-up,"" said Song Hong, an international trade researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Further opening-up in more key sectors will surely benefit the country as well as the global economy, given the vast size of the Chinese market and the great potential of the country's innovation industry and high-end manufacturing sector, said Yang Weiyong, an economics professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. China, which joined the WTO in 2001, issued a new ""negative list"" on Thursday that sets out which of its industries are closed to foreign investors. It was first drawn up in 1995 and has previously been revised seven times. Thursday's new list cuts the restrictions from 63 to 48, especially in service industry, infrastructure, railway passenger transportation, international shipping, grain purchases and wholesales. It will become effective on July 28. The pledge to widen access to Chinese markets and pursue a win-win strategy for China's trading partners comes as Beijing and Washington remain locked in a tit-for-tat import tariff threats. China's stance of further opening-up and being more inclusive is in a sharp contrast to its rival's protectionist stance, Yang said. It is clear who is right and who is wrong â the truth will eventually emerge, Yang added. ""The new negative list certainly is shorter and opens more sectors, especially the financial sector,"" said Mei Xinyu, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation. More preferential policies and lower market thresholds have been granted for foreign-provided services, Mei added. The white paper said China has revised the catalog for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries twice over the past five years, reducing restrictive measures on foreign investment by 65 percent. The government will ease market access by removing the equity cap on foreign investment in sectors such as shipbuilding and aircraft and automobile manufacturing. Since becoming a WTO member in 2001, China has comprehensively honored its tariff reduction commitments, lowering tariffs, upgrading its tariff catalog and improving the tariff structure, said Tu Xinquan, of the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. From 2001 to 2017, China's imports in goods jumped from $243.6 billion to $1.84 trillion, with an average annual growth of 13.5 percent, making the country the world's second-largest importer, data from the documents show.

A total of 8,549 types of goods originating in India, South Korea, Bangladesh, Laos and Sri Lanka will have tariffs reduced or cut to zero. The goods include chemicals, agricultural and medical products, clothing, steel and aluminum products under the second amendment of the Asia Pacific Trade Agreement, the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council announced on Tuesday. The commission said all imported products on the list from the five Asian countries will have a new tariff rate effective on Sunday. The trade agreement, formerly known as the Bangkok Agreement, signed in 1975 and renamed in 2005, has been the oldest preferential trade agreement among economies in the Asia-Pacific region. Formed by six member countries, the trade agreement covers a population of 3 billion. The change was decided upon as unilateralism and trade protectionism are on the rise and tensions appear in the trade relations among global economies. China said on June 16 it would levy an additional 25 percent tariff on 659 goods worth $50 billion from the United States, including soybeans and automobiles, in response to Washington's plan to impose tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese shipments. Many countries oppose such behavior and have already taken measures to prevent their economies from being dragged into recession, said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics. ""Countries are acutely aware that the US is not only having trade disputes with China. ... It appeared that the US is challenging the international trade system, as small economies are also under the threat of protective trade measures,"" he said. This can be an opportunity for China to restructure or diversify its import channels, said Zhou Qiangwu, director of the International Economics and Finance Institute at the Ministry of Finance. ""The ongoing trade dispute may also force China to cast off its heavy dependence on service trade with the US and conduct more international collaboration in research and development with countries including Germany, France, Russia, South Korea and Japan,"" he said. Fu Zhenzhen, an agricultural analyst with Beijing-based CnAgri specializing in grain trade, said the zero tariff on the soybean imports from listed countries is not likely to play a huge role in China's soybean supply. Most of those five Asian countries are actually in short supply of soybeans, with South Korea even importing them from China, but ""the amended trade deal will affect other sectors and help China build a better trading environment in the Asia-Pacific region"", she said.

Manufacturers in the Rust Belt fear additional tariffs would antagonize their long-standing trade partners, leading to a decrease in exports. Soybean farmers throughout the Midwest are nervously watching how China, which buys a quarter of American soybeans, will respond in kind. Traditional steel and aluminum manufacturers in the Great Lake states may benefit from the administration's 25-percent tariff on foreign steel, but for those who use the metal, it is an entirely different story. Metal users are paying higher prices. It is no strange that beverage producers fret about the impending price rises of aluminum cans, which will be passed on to consumers. According to a report from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the recent tariff list released by the Trump administration raises costs for many U.S. companies sourcing components from overseas. U.S. consumers will likely feel the effects of higher prices down the road. Never forget the fact that, trade with China allowed American families to save 850 dollars per household in 2015, a study by the U.S. China Business Council shows. This benefits brought by Chinese exports to the U.S. consumers will be gone, and higher import duties will tax American consumers more. As Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, has tweeted, ""No way you get there without putting tariffs on a lot of consumer goods imports, be it computers or cell phones and the like. More than 20 percent of the merchandise that the U.S. imported from China last year were cell phones and computers."" Economists also doubt the Trump administration's stubborn thoughts on trade deficit. Stephen Roach, former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia and senior fellow at Yale University's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs, said with the domestic saving rate at just 1.5 percent of national income in the first quarter of 2018, U.S. multilateral trade deficit with 102 nations is unavoidable. Roach has warned that trying to cure multilateral deficits with bilateral tariffs such as those being imposed on China can only backfire -- shifting the Chinese piece of the U.S. trade deficit to higher cost producers and thereby taxing American consumers. ""President Trump's trade fix runs counter to his avowed promise to make America great again,"" he said. Nevertheless, the Trump administration has doubled down on its unilateralism and protectionism by threatening to slap additional tariffs on 200 billion U.S. dollars worth of Chinese goods. This came two days after tariffs on 50 billion dollars of Chinese imports were announced, just weeks after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said his country put a trade war with China on hold. It should be noted that the storyline of the China-U.S. trade spat could have been less combative, and the Americans do not necessarily have to bear the costs of a trade war. According to the spokesperson of China's Ministry of Commerce, during their previous rounds of talks, Chinese and American negotiators had once ""borne fruit with clear negotiation roadmaps and timetables."" In other words, if the Trump administration didn't re-announce additional tariffs against Chinese products, both sides would have planned further consultations on manufacturing and services, as well as structural problems, after making detailed consultations on agriculture and energy. To enhance the resilience and competitiveness of the American economy, the U.S. government needs to foster a business and trade environment deemed by its major trading partners as reasonable and predictable. On the contrary, the U.S. government is hectically putting up trade barriers, restricting foreign investment and alienating its major trading partners. Every act has its consequences. The false passion of the U.S. administration is tarnishing the credibility and international image of the world's biggest economy, which will be another expensive mistake that the Americans have to deal with. When business environment becomes less predictable, foreign investors will leave, and so will jobs. America's domestic industrial chains will be forced to make a change. As a country who is lately consistently inconsistent, the United States of America is becoming the Unpredictable States of America. Honestly speaking, who wants uncertainty except speculators? China is cutting tariffs across the board. Effective on July 1, China's average tariff rate for clothing, shoes and hats, kitchenware, and sports and fitness supplies will be reduced by 50 percent, and that for home appliances will be lowered by two-thirds. Import taxes on vehicles and auto parts will also be slashed on the same day. But these incentives to foreign companies might have nothing to do with American manufacturers as the U.S. administration is seemingly making all out efforts to have the U.S. left out. For decades, bilateral trade has been taken as the ballast stone of China-U.S. relations. At this moment, the ballast stone is being recklessly tossed back and forth by the U.S. side. As the Chinese and American economies have been so mutually dependent, like it or not, they are already in the same boat. How can the U.S. government assure its people a journey ahead safe and sound while stirring up monstrous sea waves for China? Sadly, it seems that unless the Trump administration feels the pinch of a trade war, the American people will not be freed from the unnecessary costs. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

[Photo/China Daily] Turkey introduced new trade tariffs on imports from the United States on Thursday in response to the extra taxes its steel exports now face at the US border. Reuters said the tariffs introduced by Ankara are worth $266.5 million and are in retaliation to the US tariffs on steel imports that Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci described as ""ill-advised"" and ""unsupportable"". ""The total tariff burden today being imposed by Turkey on the US is commensurate with the additional costs Turkey faces due to the tariffs imposed on it by the US,"" Zeybekci said in a statement. The new taxes Turkey is levying will hit imports of US whiskey, vehicles, coal, paper, tobacco, rice and other products. ""They are proportional, measured and designed to protect Turkey's interests, while encouraging dialogue,"" Zeybekci said. The BBC reported on Thursday that the European Union was also set to bring in a raft of retaliatory tariffs against imports from the US. They are expected to be introduced on Friday. The new tariffs are in response to US President Donald Trump's decision in March to impose 25 percent import duties on steel arriving in the United States, and 10 percent on aluminum imports. Nations around the world have criticized Trump's move, saying it is protectionist and risks triggering a global trade war. Cecilia Malmstrom, the EU's trade commissioner, said the new EU tariffs will be aimed at imports into the trading bloc of US products, including jeans, motorbikes and whiskey. ""The unilateral and unjustified decision of the US to impose steel and aluminum tariffs on the EU means that we are left with no other choice,"" the BBC reported her as saying. The EU is expected to also begin taxing imports of US cranberries, orange juice, sweetcorn, peanut butter, and other products. Canada has also recently announced retaliatory tariffs on US imports that will be worth $12.5 billion a year. Mexico too has fought back with tariffs worth $3 billion. The latest salvos in the brewing trade war follow Trump threatening on Tuesday to impose an additional set of duties on Chinese goods that will be worth another $200 billion. These taxes come on top of recently introduced tariffs on Chinese products worth around $50 billion. China has described Washington's actions as ""blackmail"" and vowed to ""fight back firmly"". Trump, meanwhile, has said his moves are aimed at limiting the amount of relatively cheap steel flowing into the US, something he says is necessary on national security grounds."

Gao Feng, spokesman for the ministry, said the two sides had achieved positive outcomes in the agriculture and energy sectors during previous talks both in Washington in May and in Beijing early this month. ""The two sides had agreed to have another round of talks on manufacturing and service sectors and hold a detailed discussion on the structural issues in the following days,"" Gao said. ""However, we are deeply sorry that the US has been acting unpredictably with its policy-making and has triggered a trade war."" Gao said despite the positive outcomes of earlier talks, China is being forced to respond in a strong manner. ""The US is accustomed to negotiating with others while holding 'big sticks',"" Gao said. ""But it does not work with China, and such irrational behavior will do no good in solving any issue."" To counter the Trump administration's threats to slap a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese products â in addition to issuing a tariff list for $50 billion Chinese goods â China fired back by being preparing ""qualitative and quantitative"" countermeasures after introducing tariffs on the same amount of US goods, $50 billion, the Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday. That amount includes automobiles, even though China had announced lower duties on imported vehicles of an average of 13.8 percent last month. ""Lowering import tariffs is a practical measure for China to further open up,"" Gao said. ""It is a decision we take reluctantly to impose additional tariffs on imported vehicles from the US, but we have to do it to respond to the US tariff hike."" Gao said the US always blames other countries for its own inner structural problems, and accuses China of forcing technology transfers and stealing intellectual property, which is a serious distortion of the facts. ""Someone accused the Chinese government of forcing foreign companies to transfer their technology, but I have never heard of such actions,"" said Wu Song, general manager of the product and distribution department for the Asia-Pacific of Johnson Controls, a US industrial conglomerate. Economists said the US global trade deficit started to balloon several years before China's surplus surged. They said that suggests the cause of the imbalance lies somewhere other than with China. Trump's thinking on trade is largely misguided, Yukon Huang, a senior fellow in the Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told The Associated Press. ""The reason we have a trade war is that the fundamental assumptions that ... are totally wrong,"" Huang. Huang added that such assumptions included the idea that the trade deficit is a problem and that there's too much US investment in China, when in fact there's too little. The trade surplus China has with the US was caused by the country's role as the final assembly point in the industrial chain for components imported from neighboring economies, said Liang Ming, director of the institute of international trade at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing. Imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods is only an excuse for the US government to irrationally pursue political goals, as it has placed heavy restrictions on high-tech exports to China, said Lyu Xiang, a researcher at the Institute of World Economics and Politics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He said the trade deficit issue will disappear automatically or drop significantly if the US traded with China in high-tech products, including aircraft engines. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The US practice of ""using maximum pressure and blackmail"" goes against the consensus reached by the two nations on multiple occasions and has utterly disappointed the international community, the ministry said in a statement. The Trump administration threatened to slap a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion worth Chinese imports on Monday, after announcing hefty tariffs on $50 billion in made-in-China products, escalating a trade dispute that has put markets and businesses on edge. The ministry's description of a combination of ""quantitative and quality measures"" under consideration indicates that the trade war will enter a new stage, experts said. While countermeasures are less likely to hit products worth billions of dollars, what is more important is the quality and effectiveness of the measures, said Xue Rongjiu, deputy director of the Beijing-based China Society for WTO Studies. The needs of China and the US are not contradictory, given that the US wishes China to further open its market access while China focuses on upgrading its industrial structure and improving its position in the global value chain, said Sang Baichuan, director of the Institute of International Business at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. ""The US has totally ignored the fact that China already agreed to purchase more US products and pledged to further expand market access for global enterprises,"" Sang said. Ma Yu, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing, said, ""If the trade war continues, it will make goods produced by both countries less competitive and cause large-scale job losses."" ""Each side wishes the other side to back away first. But if nobody does, their losses will continue."" Li Daokui, an economist at Tsinghua University and former Chinese central bank monetary policy committee member, said US economic problems go far beyond its trade deficit. The Trump administration needs to be farsighted and address some of its fundamental issues over the long run, Li said. Bruce Blakeman, vice-president for the Asia Pacific region of Cargill Inc, the US agricultural conglomerate, said the corporation is deeply concerned by Washington's actions in issuing tariffs on Chinese products based on Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. The impact of the trade conflicts ""will lead to serious consequences for economic growth and job creation and hurt those that are most vulnerable across the globe"", Blakeman said. US automakers, for whom China is a key growth market, are also likely to be hit by bruising tariffs. Wei Jianguo, former vice-minister of commerce, said once such a move took effect, it would further push US automobile manufacturers out of the Chinese market, after the biggest share of the Chinese medium and high-end market already has been taken by vehicles from Germany, Sweden, France and Japan. US automakers may miss a golden chance to expand their footprint in China if the Trump administration sticks to trade protectionism and keeps destroying free trade, Wei said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

A slew of incentives will be taken to further boost imports, the State Council, China's cabinet, decided at an executive meeting last week chaired by Premier Li Keqiang. In response to domestic consumption upgrades and an economic shift to quality, China supports the imports of daily consumer goods, medicine, and equipment for rehabilitation and old-age care, according to the meeting. More measures are in the pipelines to lower tariffs, optimize import customs clearance, and clear up unreasonable management measures and fees. The move represents China's latest efforts to further open up its economy, as the country embraces the 40th anniversary of the reform and open-up drive, the first and foremost factor behind its economic success story. The government has announced multiple new policies to further liberalize domestic sectors and bring in more foreign products since the beginning of the year. Effective on July 1, the average tariff rate for clothing, shoes and hats, kitchenware, and sports and fitness supplies will be reduced from 15.9 percent to 7.1 percent, and that for home appliances such as washing machines and refrigerators from 20.5 percent to 8 percent. The tariff rates for other products including aquatic products, processed food, detergents, cosmetics, and some medicine will also be reduced substantially. Import taxes on vehicles and auto parts will also see marked reduction on the same day to upgrade the auto industry. ""Our initiative to boost imports demonstrates China's commitment to a new round of high-standard opening up, to economic restructuring, and to economic transformation and high-quality development,"" Li said. China has been striving to reduce tariffs. More than 8,000 types of imported goods now enjoy duty-free policies, based on free trade agreements with 23 countries and regions.

Widened access for foreign goods will allow Chinese consumers to enjoy more quality products and prompt domestic companies to improve their competitiveness, said Zhang Jianping, researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation under the Ministry of Commerce. Given steady economic expansion, China has been vigorous in foreign trade over the past years, overtaking the United States as the world's largest goods trading nation in 2017. In breakdown, the country has been the world's largest exporter and second largest importer of goods for nine consecutive years, and is now the world's largest importer of energy resources. China contributed 10.2 percent to global imports last year. From automobiles and crude oil to soy beans and medicine, Chinese buyers are driving growth in a range of different sectors around the world. China boasts the world's largest middle-income group who have a bigger appetite and higher requirements for products from daily necessities to electronic equipment, creating huge opportunities for foreign businesses.

Chinese authorities expect the country to import goods worth 24 trillion U.S. dollars in the next 15 years, along with attracting 2 trillion dollars of foreign investment. China's goods imports jumped 15.6 percent year on year to 1.19 trillion yuan (around 185 billion U.S. dollars) in May, leading to a 43.1-percent decline in trade surplus.

Additional tariffs for 545 items worth about 34 billion U.S. dollars, including agricultural products, vehicles and aquatic products, will be effective from July 6, 2018, according to a statement of the commission. The implementation date for imposing additional tariffs on the remaining 114 items, covering chemical products, medical equipment and energy products, will be announced later. The decision has been made in line with relevant stipulations of the Foreign Trade Law of China and the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Import and Export Duties, as well as the fundamental principles of international laws, said the statement. On Friday, the United States announced additional tariffs of 25 percent on Chinese imports worth approximately 50 billion U.S. dollars. From July 6, additional tariffs will be levied on some 34 billion U.S. dollars worth of Chinese products. Meanwhile, the other 16 billion dollars worth of Chinese products will undergo further review in a public notice and comment process. ""The U.S. move violates the relevant rules of the World Trade Organization, goes against the consensus already reached in bilateral economic and trade consultations, seriously infringes upon the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese side and undermines the interests of China and its people,"" said the statement.

An official in charge of the Office of the Customs Tariff Commission said that the additional tariffs targeting Chinese goods, once imposed, would ""substantially change"" the trade conditions of these goods, and affect relevant producers and trade companies as well as the production and operation of the upstream and downstream industries. The official said the Chinese action was taken in response to the emergent circumstances caused by the U.S. violations of international obligations. China has noticed the U.S. statement that it will continue to impose additional tariffs if China takes retaliatory measures.

At the invitation of Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the top US diplomat will visit China on Thursday. The two sides will exchange ideas on bilateral ties and major international and regional issues of mutual concern, with the US side briefing China about the US-North Korea leaders' meeting in Singapore, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said at a regular press conference on Wednesday. Through the event, China hopes the two sides could enhance mutual understanding, seek ways to properly handle and manage disputes, strengthen cooperation, and push bilateral ties forward along the right track, Geng noted. The visit would mark Pompeo's first formal visit to China since he took office in April, and take place closely following the historic North Korea-US leaders' summit on Tuesday. China's foreign ministry has not disclosed further specifics for the event as of press time, whereas the US official tweeted soon after the summit on Tuesday, revealing that his trip to Beijing is ""to continue to build the dream to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."" During the summit held on Tuesday in Singapore's resort island of Sentosa, US President Donald Trump and his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-un signed a joint statement where the two leaders agreed to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in exchange for security guarantees of North Korea, the Xinhua News Agency reported. The US-North Korea agreements are frameworks at best, waiting to be processed into tangible stages before implementation, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University's Institute of International Relations in Beijing, told the Global Times. As the US side increasingly recognizes the China-proposed ""double suspension"" and ""dual track approach"" as the best option to handle the Korean Peninsula issues and the irreplaceable role played by a cooperative China on the matter, it would be on the top of Pompeo's agenda to listen to China's opinion on how to transform the agreements into reality, Li added. Also, talks on properly addressing China-US trade friction will inevitably take place during Pompeo's stay in Beijing, Liu Weidong, a research fellow at Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. It would be inconsistent with the upbeat momentum achieved on the Korean Peninsula issues and US seeking higher cooperation with China on the matter, if the US insists to slap such a heavy blow to China in the trade sector, Liu said.

A merchat shows bread from Estonia at the 4th China- Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC) Investment and Trade Expo The faster pace of opening up not only offers new choices for domestic consumers, but also attracts the attention of global merchants. The 4th China- Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC) Investment and Trade Expo kicked off in Ningbo, eastern Chinaâs Zhejiang province on June 8. The event attracted 257 exhibitors from the CEEC, introducing nearly 1,000 different products in 15 major categories. In the 8,400-square meter exhibition hall, drinks, cakes, and chocolate from Latvia, as well as wine and olive oil from Hungary were all favored by Chinese buyers. âAgricultural products such as red wine, dairy products, oats and canned fish are very popular in China,â a CEEC exhibitor told Economic Information Daily. He said Chinaâs growing consumption has led to larger domestic demand for quality, pollution-free food. The 4th China- CEEC Investment and Trade Expo is just one example of Chinaâs expansion in openness and global merchants are running to China in search of opportunities. Chinaâs State Council announced a decision to lower most-favored-nation (MFN) tariffs for 1,449 taxable daily consumer goods starting July 1, said Li Mingtao, director of the Academy of China International Electronic Commerce Center. It's an important measure to expand import and promote trade balance, the director added. âThanks to such favorable policies, CEEC countries have seen an increase in export volume to China. China-Europe freight trains have largely improved the freight load factor for return trips and reduced transportation costs, thus further strengthening trade cooperation between China and the CEEC,â said an organizer of the 4th China- CEEC Investment and Trade Expo. The organizer added that this tariff cut will benefit both foreign suppliers and their Chinese agents. In addition, the continuously deepening international cooperation in e-commerce will also contribute to the next expansion of e-commerce in China. At the Third Ministerial Conference of China-CEEC on Promoting Trade and Economic Cooperation on Jun. 7, China proposed working together to optimize the e-commerce development environment. 16 CEECs have already responded to the proposal expressing support.

Details will be confirmed later by both sides as the delegations concluded a third round of trade talks in Beijing on Sunday following Washington two weeks ago and Beijing in early May. Led by US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, the US delegates met for two days with the Chinese side led by Vice Premier Liu He. ""To implement the consensus reached in Washington, the two sides have had good communication in various areas such as agriculture and energy, and have made positive and concrete progress while relevant details have yet to be confirmed by both sides,"" the statement said. All the economic and trade achievements negotiated by the two parties will not take effect if the US still goes ahead and introduces tariffs, according to a statement released by the Chinese side on Sunday, the Xinhua News Agency reported. ""All the trade achievements between China and the US should be on the premise that the two countries will not launch a trade war,"" the China statement said. China's bottom line was to avoid a trade war and it was also the precondition for realizing the achievements of trade talks, Bai Ming, deputy director of the Beijing-based international market research institute at the Ministry of Commerce, told the Global Times on Sunday. ""China's statement is targeting Trump's capricious attitude toward bilateral trade disputes, which has aroused much concern,"" Bai said. The US will impose a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of goods from China containing industrially significant technology, including those related to the Made in China 2025 program, according to a statement issued by the US government on May 29 just before Ross' China journey. The final list of imports will be announced by June 15, the statement said. Separately, by June 30, the US will issue its proposed restrictions on investment related to Chinese institutions and companies seeking to acquire American technology, the White House said. The weekend talks may have marked a step forward, but the face-off, contrary to the Washington consensus reached on May 15-19, shows there is a way to go for both nations, Bai said. Both sides communicated well on the implementation of the Washington consensus when Liu led a delegation to Washington for economic and trade consultations with the US side, Xinhua reported. During the Washington talks, China and the US issued a joint statement on May 19, vowing not to launch a trade war against each other. According to the statement released on Sunday, China agreed to increase imports from other countries, including the US, so as to meet the consumption needs of the Chinese people and propel high-quality economic development. Consensus was most likely to be reached first in agriculture and energy, Bai said, as China, the world's largest consumption market, relies on imports in these sectors. The US is aiming for a $375 billion reduction in its trade deficit with China. China was sticking to its development path by expanding domestic demand, increasing imports and attaching importance to trade negotiations with the world's largest economy, said Huo Jianguo, a senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing. But risks and challenges remain for China, Huo told the Global Times on Sunday. ""For example, the US side might not repeal the announced tariff and investment restriction plan when Ross returns to the country or it might pursue more offers from China."" That was why no concrete agreement was disclosed when the Beijing talks concluded Sunday, Huo believed. ""The US has time to consider whether to accept the negotiation results, but Ross seems satisfied with the result, revealing a positive attitude,"" Huo said. The meetings so far ""have been friendly and frank, and covered some useful topics about specific export items,"" Reuters quoted Ross as saying on Sunday. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance and the National Energy Administration announced a cut in the national feed-in-tariff by 0.05 yuan ($0.008) per kilowatt-hour and a reduction of the same amount in subsidies for power generated by distributed PV projects. As a result, the on-grid power tariffs now range from 0.5 yuan to 0.7 yuan. There will be no change to the subsidies for county-level poverty alleviation PV projects. Some media reports said this policy approach was the most austere in years, and that it indicated a more significant rollback of subsidies for industry players. Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, said the policy will curb the fast growth of PV power bases, amid efforts by the central government to make electricity cheaper for consumers. ""This year's government work report clearly stipulated that 2018 electricity prices will be lowered by 10 percent. But the PV subsidy comes from continuous hiking of electricity prices in the past, which was paid for by ordinary consumers,"" Lin told the Global Times on Sunday, He added that with the need to cut electricity prices, the PV subsidies must now be scaled back. A member of staff surnamed Liu with the PR department of Chinese solar panel maker Trina Solar Ltd said that as the policy has only just come out, it is hard to see what its impact will be. An article on the public WeChat account of the China Photovoltaic Industry Association said Friday that while the sector's growth momentum might not be sustained, PV power will remain a key force in the nation's energy revolution and will still receive State support. The association said the fact that PV installations can generate power at a lower cost than other power sources in many countries is the Chinese PV industry's greatest strength. ""Given that equipment costs have been steadily reduced in the past few years, it is only reasonable for the subsidy to be lowered. The reduction is mild, but still unexpected,"" Lin said, noting that many PV power plants are still being built. Surplus factor A second but less important reason for the policy move is that there is a surplus in domestic electricity production, Lin said, so the feed-in tariff is not sustainable. According to news site guacha.cn, the renewable energy subsidy gap had reached 100 billion yuan as of the end of 2017. In 2017, the nation's main power stations saw their equipment utilization total 3,786 hours, down 11 hours from 2016, according to the National Energy Administration. China is taking the lead in PV development globally, with an internationally competitive and complete industrial chain, according to a report by the Xinhua News Agency over the weekend. The central government is aiming for 27 percent of total power generation to come from renewable energy sources by the end of 2020, according to the 2016-20 plan for renewable energy. Lin said the surplus in the domestic market will encourage upstream firms in the sector to seek opportunities abroad. And because of the strong obstacles in the EU and US markets, due to various anti-dumping probes, the drive for overseas expansion could focus on Africa and other regions along the routes of the China-proposed Belt and Road initiative. Lin also noted that Chinese companies' reliance on the EU and US markets has been reduced significantly in recent years. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The WTO Secretariat received a request from the EU for consultations with the United States ""concerning the Section 232 tariffs imposed by the United States on steel and aluminum imports"", said the official who requested anonymity. The request for consultations formally initiates a dispute in the WTO. After 60 days, if consultations have failed to resolve the dispute, the EU may request adjudication by a panel. Despite worldwide objection, the U.S. administration decided in March to impose a 25-percent tariff on steel imports and a 10-percent tariff on aluminum imports. The EU's move came against the announcement on Thursday by U.S. President Donald Trump not to extend the temporary steel and aluminum tariff exemptions against the EU, Canada, and Mexico. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said this was because negotiations over the past two months have failed to result in a deal. Regarding the dispute with the United States, the EU says in a document submitted to the WTO that U.S. tariff measures ""adversely affect exports of these goods from the European Union to the United States.""

U.S. President Donald Trump has decided not to extend the temporary steel and aluminum tariff exemptions for these three key trading partners, Ross told reporters at a conference call. ""We look forward to continued negotiations with Canada and Mexico on one hand and with the European Commission on the other hand as there are other issues we need to get resolved,"" he said. In March, Trump announced plans to impose 25-percent tariff on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum, while delaying implementation for some trading partners to offer concessions to avoid the tariffs. The White House said in late April that the steel and aluminum tariff exemptions for EU member countries, Canada and Mexico would be extended until June 1 in order to give ""a final 30 days"" for them to reach agreements over trade negotiations. But those negotiations have so far failed to result in a deal. ""The United States was unable to reach satisfactory arrangements, however, with Canada, Mexico, or the European Union, after repeatedly delaying tariffs to allow more time for discussions,"" the White House said Thursday in a statement. The Trump administration is using the so-called Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act from 1962, a decades-old law, to slap tariffs on imported steel and aluminum products on the ground of national security, which has drawn strong opposition from the domestic business community and U.S. trading partners. The administration's latest move is likely to further increase trade frictions between the United States and its major trading partners. ""The EU believes these unilateral U.S. tariffs are unjustified and at odds with WTO (World Trade Organization) rules. This is protectionism, pure and simple,"" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said Thursday in a statement. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom added that the EU will now trigger a dispute settlement case at the WTO, since these U.S. measures ""clearly go against"" agreed international rules. The EU will use the possibility under WTO rules to rebalance the situation by targeting a list of U.S. products with additional duties, and the level of tariffs to be applied will reflect the damage caused by the new U.S. trade restrictions on EU products, according to the EU. Analysts said the U.S. decision to move forward steel and aluminum tariffs against Canada and Mexico could also complicate the talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Talks on renegotiating the NAFTA began in August 2017 as Trump threatened to withdraw from the 23-year-old trade deal. Following multiple rounds of talks, the three countries remain divided over the rules of origin for autos and other issues. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

China announced Wednesday a series of opening-up measures to create a fairer, more transparent and easier investment environment for foreign-funded companies. The measures include relaxing market access, enhancing investment and better protecting the interests of foreign investors, according to an executive meeting of the State Council chaired by Premier Li Keqiang. At the meeting it was decided that investment facilitation would be enhanced based on international standards. The negative list on market access for foreign investors will be revised and released before July 1. ""These measures are China's concrete moves to fulfill its commitment of wider opening-up and also meet the demand of its own development goals,"" said Bai Ming with the research department of the Ministry of Commerce. ""Attracting foreign investment is very much in line with China's supply-side structural reform, which calls for higher-quality resources,"" said Yang Changyong, a senior researcher from the Chinese Academy of Macroeconomic Research. Since China began reform and opening-up four decades ago, foreign investment has created an important boost for economic growth. Foreign direct investment in the Chinese mainland rose 7.9 percent to reach 878 billion yuan (138.6 billion U.S. dollars) in 2017, an all-time high. ""As China transitions from high-speed growth to high-quality development, the quality of foreign investment should also be improved,"" Yang said. ""To attract more high-quality investment, China should create a more encouraging environment, with mechanisms such as the negative list approach pushed forward."" Besides wider market access, China pledged to expand imports, as it aligns with the country's goal of increasing consumption. During Wednesday's meeting, the premier announced further cuts of import tariffs for consumer goods starting July 1, including clothing, shoes, home appliances and cosmetics, to meet demand and boost quality and industrial upgrading. The announcement came on the heels of China's plan last week to cut import tariffs on vehicles and auto parts from July 1 to upgrade the auto industry. ""As people's incomes increase, the demand for healthy food, healthcare products and creative cultural goods is showing rapid growth, and imports in these fields will meet such demand,"" said Li Dawei, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Macroeconomic Research. He said tariff cuts would help China achieve balanced trade, upgrade the domestic industrial chain and boost technology innovation. ""Expanding imports is an important way to achieve mutual benefit,"" said Li, noting that China's huge market potential would enable other countries to achieve common development and prosperity.

The announcement came just ahead of US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross' visit to China from Saturday to Monday. The statement goes against the consensus the two countries reached in Washington about two weeks ago. Also on Wednesday, the Ministry of Commerce confirmed that a US trade delegation arrived in Beijing for negotiations. Over the next few days, the US delegation of more than 50 people will talk with China's team about implementing the consensus reached in the joint statement, the ministry said on its website. US-China Business Council President John Frisbie said: ""We would like to see both sides put the threat of sanctions on hold and quickly get into negotiations to resolve these important issues. Tariffs and restrictions on commerce will have a real and negative impact on the economy and jobs. ""We need solutions that will put the trade relationship on a sounder path for mutual prosperity, not sanctions that will do more harm than good. We encourage both sides to use the coming weeks to achieve that goal,"" he said. In light of the renewed tariff threat from the US, analysts expect a tough job ahead for the third round high-level economic and trade meeting starting on Saturday in Beijing. The US intends to put more pressure on China with this move to gain more economic interests before the talks start in Beijing, said Zhou Qiangwu, director of the international economics and finance institute at the Ministry of Finance. ""The US-China trade friction could evolve into far-reaching disputes,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report. ""Furthermore, such trade tensions may not fade away easily, given the urgency possibly being felt by US policymakers who had expected more political convergence from China."" The US threats came just over a week after trade tensions between the two countries had seemingly eased. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on May 20 that the trade dispute was ""on hold"". His comment followed a commitment by China to significantly increase its purchases of US farm goods and energy products. Mei Xinyu, a researcher at the International Trade and Economic Cooperation Institute of the Ministry of Commerce, said China should prepare for the worst, as US trade policies toward China have been so capricious. The country must carefully observe the US government's behavior no matter what kind of bilateral consensuses or deals have been reached. It is unfair to impose sanctions on China, as the country's exports that are subject to potential US tariffs have low added value, said Teng Jianqun, director of the Department for American Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, after checking the latest list renewed by the US."

""The transfer of technology from the U.S. companies to China is a normal business.

Construction on the bicycle-only road will start by September and finish in June next year, according to Beijingâs Municipal Commission of Transportation. The new cycling road will span 6.5 kilometers and will provide cyclists with a route through heavily populated areas in northwest Beijing. The road will also have no crossings or traffic lights, which will be a boon for fast riding and efficiency. China's first and longest elevated bikeway, Xiamen. (File Photo) The bikeway is designed to handle more than 1,000 bikes per hour in each of its lanes. Similar to sparing room for motor vehicles during peak hours, the new road will also have reversible and overtaking lanes to mitigate congestion. The cycling road will use several methods to prevent invasive automobiles from using the road, including monitors to record misconduct. China's first and longest elevated bikeway, Xiamen.

Cyclists also have prioritized road rights. Germany also has an impressive system of bikeways. In its downtown areas, cycling lanes are often mixed with pedestrian ways and motor lanes, where speed limits are low. In areas that have higher speed limits, bikeways are separated from the main road with strips of grass or blocking lines. In rural areas, roads are almost exclusively designed for cyclists."

Beginning July 1, China's average tariff rate on vehicles will be 13.8 percent, while that for auto parts will be 6 percent, lower than the average of developing economies and in line with China's reality. Some foreign auto heavyweights such as Audi have promptly reacted with plans to lower prices in order to benefit Chinese consumers. COMMITMENT TO FREE TRADE China's automobile tariffs were significantly reduced to 25 percent by 2006 after its accession to the WTO in 2001, a relatively low rate for a developing economy. The 25-percent duties may seem high compared with auto-making powerhouses like the United States, but it was necessary for the healthy development of China's car industry, said Xu Haidong, assistant to the secretary general of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM). China remains a developing country, Xu said. By 2010, China had fulfilled its tariff-cutting promises for WTO membership by cutting overall tariff levels from 15.3 percent to 9.8 percent by 2010, said Liu Shangxi, head of the Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences. The latest voluntary tariff cut will directly benefit the economic growth and employment of car exporters, Liu said. ""Many positive effects will be felt in the global economy."" Most of China's car imports last year were from the United States, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom. The auto tariffs cuts are important measures that comply with trade liberalization, as the world witnesses a broad reduction in automobile tariffs driven by economic globalization and global trade, according to Li Xuhong, a researcher with the Beijing National Accounting Institute. UPGRADING CONSUMPTION The Ministry of Finance said the tariff cut will enrich domestic market supply and meet the diverse needs of the people to provide more plentiful and affordable consumer experiences. China has been the world's largest car market for nine consecutive years, with vehicle production and sales in 2017 reaching 29 million units and 28.8 million units, respectively, CAAM data showed. Last year, China imported 1.22 million vehicles, most of which were high-end SUVs, to account for some 4.2 percent of total sales, while domestic brands saw growing market share. Industry analysts expect the remarkable tariff cut to meet domestic demand for imported high-end cars, as rising income has led to a burgeoning market for luxury cars. Over 670,000 luxury cars were sold in China during the Jan.-April period, up 22.3 percent year on year, data from the China Passenger Car Association showed. China's domestically produced cars are more internationally competitive than they were five or 10 years ago, meaning that the country's recent opening-up measures in the auto sector will have a smaller impact, according to Paul Gong, executive director of UBS Investment Research Asia Autos. CONTINUED OPENING-UP The tariff cuts come after China unveiled a plan last month to phase out equity caps for automotive joint ventures in the world's largest car market amid a broader push for further opening. ""The development of China's auto industry was enabled by the country's reform and opening-up and economic globalization,"" said Dong Yang, deputy head of the CAAM. Opening-up has been key to China's economic growth over the past 40 years, and the future high-quality development of China's economy can only be achieved with greater openness, as China promised at the Boao Forum for Asia in April that its doors will only open wider. The promise has quickly materialized in the form of landmark opening measures launched this year, including opening the car-making sectors wider to foreign investors and introducing a plan to establish a free-trade port system in the country's southernmost island province of Hainan.

""US officials familiar with the offer"" told Reuters that China has offered US President Donald Trump a package of proposed purchases of US goods and other measures aimed at reducing the US trade deficit with China by some $200 billion a year. The alleged offer was made during the China-US trade talks in Washington, and is reportedly aimed at resolving tariff threats and other trade irritants between the world's two largest economies. But it was not immediately clear how the amount was determined. 'Disunity' in US team As both sides are still in the middle of consultations or negotiations, it is very unprofessional to release information or rumors on the talks, and unhelpful to both sides, Bai Ming, deputy director of the International Market Research Institute, told the Global Times on Friday. ""China would like to reduce the deficit but it won't work in the way that the US has proposed, which simply sets a figure as a goal and China merely purchases the goods or services every year to meet this goal, because this violates the law of supply and demand,"" Bai said. The US probably wants to increase pressure on China by releasing such a message, or reflects the disunity within the US team, Diao Daming, a US studies expert and an associate professor at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Friday. ""If the result is different from the report, then the US public might blame the moderates on the team, and this is what hardliners want to see."" A long-standing rift between US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and US President Donald Trump's ""nationalist trade adviser"" Peter Navarro ""hit new levels"" on the sidelines of the trade talks with China in Beijing earlier this month, CNN reported on Thursday. Respect for free trade Lu said that the consultations are part of a process of ""mutual understanding and mutual accommodation."" The US has positively responded to China's concerns over the ZTE case, and this is a positive sign, Diao said. ""China will also show its sincerity toward US concerns. However, this is not in response to US pressure, but based on the sincere will of solving the problem"" and China's opening-up on its own initiative. The primary reason for the imbalanced trade relationship is the low demand in China of US products that the US is willing to provide, Bai noted. ""The US government occasionally contradicts itself. For instance, it bans its high-tech companies from selling products and technologies to China, but, at the same time, complains about the huge deficit."" ""The US should realize that the deficit will not be reduced simply by increasing exports of agricultural or energy products to China, and it should learn to respect market forces,"" Bai said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

""We hope that the two sides can meet each other halfway, and properly resolve disputes and manage differences through consultations, based on the principle of mutual respect and equal consultation,"" MOC spokesperson Gao Feng said at a press conference. Gao also expressed hope that the two sides would make joint efforts to advance bilateral economic and trade cooperation. ""China does not want to see escalating Sino-U.S. economic and trade friction, but is prepared for all possible scenarios,"" Gao said. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He arrived in Washington Tuesday afternoon for economic and trade consultations with the U.S. side at the invitation of the U.S. government. Gao reiterated China's opposition to the U.S. Section 301 investigation and urged the United States to cease investigation procedures. The Section 301 investigation is ""an act of unilateralism"" and ""unpopular with the public,"" he said, citing that more than 90 percent of the 2,000-plus published comments during the hearings opposed the tariff proposal. ""China expects the United States to take concrete action as soon as possible on a case involving Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE, and to resolve it in a fair and reasonable manner,"" he said. The comment came after U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet Sunday that the two sides are working together to give ZTE ""a way to get back into business, fast,"" and the U.S. Commerce Department has been instructed to work on the issue. Gao pointed out that market forces were behind China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation.

[Photo/VCG] Vice-Premier Liu He will visit the United States as President Xi Jinping's special envoy from Tuesday to Saturday for economic and trade talks, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday. Liu will lead a delegation in talks with the US team headed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at the invitation of the US administration, said Lu Kang, the ministry's spokesman. These will follow high-level meetings in Beijing on May 3 and 4. Both sides are expected to continue discussing issues like expansion of US exports to China, trade in services, two-way investment, the protection of intellectual property rights and the resolution of tariff and non-tariff measures, said Tu Xinquan, a trade professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he has instructed the Commerce Department to help China's ZTE Corp get back to business, and Lu said China appreciates the latest positive comment on ZTE. He said China has maintained close communication with the US. ZTE, a major telecom equipment manufacturer, said last week it would suspend major operations following last month's move by Washington to ban US companies from selling certain computer chips to the Chinese company until 2025. The US has accused ZTE of violating laws by illegally shipping US goods to Iran and breaching a deal reached last year. ZTE has appealed. ZTE says the ban would ""severely impact the survival and development"" of the company, which depends on US companies to supply about a quarter of its technology components. ""I see this as a positive step and hope it will create a better atmosphere for the ongoing discussions between the two countries,"" said Henry Levine, a former US deputy assistant secretary of commerce. ""I hope Beijing can respond with a positive step of its own and hope that both Beijing and Washington can begin a ... process where each takes positive steps and the other one responds with its own positive steps,"" he said. Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former China division chief at the International Monetary Fund, said the move of the Trump administration sets the stage for a temporary de-escalation of trade tensions between the two countries.

Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remark in an instruction released on Monday. In June, 24 academicians from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering who were working in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region wrote a letter to Xi to express their will to contribute to the country and their enthusiasm for developing innovative science and technology. Xi attached great importance to the letter, made instructions and quickly arranged the relevant works, according to Xinhua News Agency. In the instructions, Xi stressed promoting scientific cooperation between the SAR and the mainland. The president also encouraged Hong Kong's scientific community to contribute to building a strong country of science and technology and fulfill national rejuvenation. The scientific advantages of the mainland and the SAR should be fully used to develop the economy and improve people's lives, which is necessary to implement the principle of ""one country, two systems"" in Hong Kong, Xi said. Hong Kong has a great amount of high-quality scientific talent, he said, and they love the country and the SAR. He called them an important force for implementing the strategy of innovation-driven development and building an innovative country. Hong Kong's scientific community has made great contributions to the development of the country and Hong Kong, Xi said. The president attaches great importance to the problems mentioned in the letter of the academicians, saying that they must be resolved in a proper way with concrete measures. Following Xi's instructions, the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Finance have had meetings and collected opinions from the Hong Kong scientific community to find measures to address the problems. The problems mentioned in the academicians' letter, including the need for increased use of national scientific project funds in Hong Kong and tariff reductions for scientific machines, have been mostly resolved. Hong Kong-based scientists stand as a major force in the country's technological push, and should be allowed to play a more proactive part in the big story unfolding in the motherland, says Chan Ching-chuen, founding president of the World Electric Vehicles Association. ""A higher level of science-technology cooperation between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong is something inherent in the 'one country, two systems' principle. It stands as a living embodiment that the policy has been consistently enriched and developed,"" said Chan, who also serves as honorary professor at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Hong Kong. ""The strength of Hong Kong-based scientists should be given full play,"" Chan added. Joseph Sung Jao-yiu, a Hong Kong scientist and the previous vice-chancellor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said his team is one of the first beneficiaries of the relaxed cross-border research fund. His team had been granted 990,000 yuan ($156,000) at the end of last year for his ongoing research on digestive cancers. ""President Xi's instructions open a door for Hong Kong scientists and researchers,"" said Sung. ""It gives our research jobs flexibility. Easy interchange between Hong Kong and Guangdong province facilitates the exchanges between scientists and researchers from both sides. ""In the future, Hong Kong research teams could apply for funding directly without the necessity of partnering with mainland researchers."" Nancy Ip Yuk-yu, vice-president for research and graduate studies of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said she was moved and encouraged by Xi's latest instruction. Ip said it reflected that the country attaches great importance to Hong Kong's scientific research, which could create favorable conditions for the SAR's development in related fields as well as facilitating more collaboration between scientists in Hong Kong and the mainland. Ip, who is a Hong Kong academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, also thought Xi's speech proved that the SAR's capacity for scientific research has received the country's recognition, which could encourage Hong Kong scientists to be better integrated into the national development in innovation and technology.

[Photo/Xinhua] If talks fail, nation is resolute in its response to planned Trump tariffs China will resolutely defend its interests even as it expects a positive outcome from the upcoming China-US trade talks through efforts from both sides, the Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday. The ministry issued the statement ahead of a planned May 15 hearing by the Office of the US Trade Representative to discuss proposed 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese imports. During the hearing, US companies and consumers will have the chance to have certain products taken off the list or others added through public discussion and lobbying. Regarding this issue of China-US trade friction, China's stance has been very clear. China opposes any form of unilateralism and protectionism in trading. The US must withdraw its threats, said Gao Feng, spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce. As China and the US will conduct the second high-level economic and trade consultations in the US soon, Gao said China hopes the two sides can work together to jointly advance bilateral business ties and gain mutual benefit for the good of the people in both countries and the world as a whole. The Ministry of Commerce also announced on Wednesday that Vice-Premier Liu He will lead a delegation to the US to discuss economic and trade issues at an appropriate time, marking the second high-level meeting since a bilateral trade dispute escalated in March. The first talks were in Beijing on May 3 and 4. Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said the Chinese delegation's visit will be helpful to tell the US public that unilaterally imposing a tariff on China will generate a huge impact on the US economy. ""This will send a signal to companies or people attending the hearing that proposed tariffs will penalize US consumers by increasing prices on consumer and technology products,"" he said. ""Both sides definitely will discuss the details on this issue in the US."" The administration of US President Donald Trump escalated trade tensions with China in late March by invoking Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974 to probe China's intellectual property and technology transfer. A tariff list was issued targeting 1,300 Chinese products, including industrial robots and telecommunications equipment. Business leaders in the US have voiced concerns about the negative impact of a possible worsening China-US trade relationship and pinned high hopes on the resumed talks between the two countries. William Cohen, US defense secretary from 1997 to 2001 and now chief executive of the Cohen Group, said there were legitimate concerns to be addressed, but he emphasized that it's important to address them in a responsible fashion so that everyone is in a win-win situation. ""I don't feel the (Trump) administration has a strategy for achieving that,"" Cohen said. ""The stated objective of doing it within the next two years is pretty short term. I don't think it's possible."" According to US media reports, the US trade delegation that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin led to Beijing last week demanded China cut the bilateral deficit by $100 billion a year over the next two years, a demand that most economists regard as untenable because US fiscal policy and low savings rates in the US are the primary cause of the deficit."

According to the report released by the U.S. Department of Commerce and statistics provided by the U.S. Department of Defense, ""it is obvious that the reason of these measures is not national security"", Zhang said in a meeting of WTO General Council, adding that the imports subject to the latest imposed tariffs account for only 5 percent of U.S. steel consumption. Zhang noted that the U.S. import of steel accounts for around 16 percent of its consumption, and about 70 percent of its import comes from the members exempted, temporarily or permanently, from the new tariff measures. ""Such measures should be considered as safeguard measures under the Agreement of Safeguards, and meet necessary requirements as set in that agreement,"" underlined the Chinese diplomat. Despite worldwide objection, the U.S. administration decided in March to impose a 25-percent tariff on steel imports and a 10-percent tariff on aluminum imports. The U.S. then provided temporary exemptions for EU member states as well as Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea. It is reported that the United States sought quotas or voluntary export restraints during its negotiations with economies requesting permanent exemption from U.S. steel tariffs. Zhang said that those actions are explicitly prohibited by the WTO rules and put the global trade back to the old era of quotas. China would call on the whole membership to urge the U.S. to honor its obligations under the WTO Agreements and to immediately withdraw its tariff measures, he concluded. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Senior commerce officials from both sides fully exchanged views and reached consensus on a number of issues, including the expansion of US exports to China, bilateral trade in services, two-way investment, the protection of intellectual property rights and the resolution of tariff and nontariff measures, Xinhua News Agency reported on Friday. However, officials from both countries recognized that major differences still exist and they must step up efforts and make more progress. They agreed to maintain close contact with each other on relevant issues and set up a corresponding work mechanism, according to Xinhua. Adequately settling trade and economic disputes through negotiations on an equal footing and maintaining the overall stability of trade relations are in line with the common interests of both countries and the world as a whole, said Mei Xinyu, a senior researcher of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation of the Ministry of Commerce. Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said that as the world's two biggest economies, the US and China are intensely interdependent and intertwined, and it is inevitable that any protective trade measures that are put into place will hurt the global value chain. Taking into account the size of the Chinese and US economies and the complexity of their relationship, it is unrealistic to resolve all of the thorny issues through talks lasting two days, Tu added. The two sides should make full use of work mechanisms and channels for dialogue in the future to resolve remaining disputes, under the principles of being fair, sincere, rational and pragmatic, said Wei Jianguo, former vice-minister of commerce. The sides are expected to reach common ground and seek the maximum common interest, Wei added. Long Guoqiang, vice-president of the Development Research Center of the State Council, said, ""In addition to talks and communications between governments, the role of companies and think tanks in easing trade tensions should be further highlighted."" According to Long, US companies can do more to serve as stabilizers of the bilateral trade and economic relationship, and Chinese companies in the US should also be encouraged to voice their concerns and legitimate rights. The Ministry of Commerce said on Friday that US officials agreed at the trade talks to raise China's objections to sanctions against Chinese telecom gear maker ZTE with US President Donald Trump. A ministry spokesman said China lodged its complaints during the meetings and the US side took the complaints seriously and agreed to report them to Trump. S&P Global, a rating agency, warned recently that US-listed manufacturing, energy and financial groups have seen a heavier impact from the tariffs than Chinese companies.

If U.S. President Donald Trump's administration cannot rein in the escalating trade tension with China over a tit-for-tat tariff war, the United States will lose nearly 455,000 jobs and 49.2 billion U.S. dollars in the value of gross domestic product annually in the first couple of years, an agricultural newspaper in the U.S. western state of Washington said. A full-blown trade war would cost America nearly 134,000 jobs and a 2.9-billion-dollar reduction in U.S. output annually, the Oregon-based weekly Capital Press said Thursday, quoting a new research by Trade Partnerships Worldwide, LLC, an international trade and economic consulting firm. Nearly half of those job losses, 67,248, would be in agriculture, and net farm income would drop 6.7 percent annually, it said. ""Agricultural jobs are going to get hit the hardest among all the sectors we looked at,"" Laura Baughman, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide, LLC, told Capital Press. Early last month, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to slap 25 percent tariffs on 150 billion dollars worth of Chinese exports to the United States over a so-called U.S. trade deficit against China. China responded with the same amount of tariffs on U.S. exports to China. Even with no retaliation from China and U.S. tariffs on only 50 billion dollars in imports, the United States would suffer more than 76,000 job losses and a 1.6-billion-dollar decline in its GDP, analysts said. This would mean the loss of more than 7,000 jobs and less than 1 percent in net farm income annually in the first couple of years, Capital Press said.

""The U.S. decision prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions. The EU should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security,"" said the European Commission in a statement shortly after the temporary extension. ""As a longstanding partner and friend of the US, we will not negotiate under threat. Any future transatlantic work program has to be balanced and mutually beneficial,"" said the statement. The glory of the transatlantic relationship has further faded recently due to the deepening trade row between the two sides, with the United States accusing the EU for taking America's advantage with unfair tariffs while the latter blame the former for too much protectionism and ""blackmailing"". In 2017, the 28-nation bloc exported 5.99 billion U.S. dollars worth of steel products to the United States, and 1.25 billion dollars of aluminum, making it the top exporter of steel to the United States and the fifth largest aluminum exporter. Since U.S. President Donald Trump announced the planned tariff-hike in early March, the EU has been fighting for a permanent exemption. Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel went to Washington to work out trans-Atlantic trade issues but left with empty hands. To show a united front, Merkel, Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday warned after a joint phone call that ""the United States should take no trade measures against the European Union or else the European Union should be ready to defend its interests within the framework of the multilateral trade order."" LINGERING PAIN The White House's Monday announcement gave the EU a lingering pain more than a sigh of relief. Shortly after the announcement, EU's top three economies -- Germany, France, and Britain -- voiced their demand for permanent exemption one after another. Calling the renewed exemption as ""positive"", the British International Trade Department said in a brief statement that Britain ""will continue to work closely with our EU partners and the U.S. government to achieve a permanent exemption, ensuring our important steel and aluminum industries are safeguarded."" ""We remain concerned about the impact of these tariffs on global trade and will continue to work with the EU on a multilateral solution to the global problem of overcapacity, as well as to manage the impact on domestic markets,"" said the statement. Requesting permanent exemption, Germany also warned ""neither the European Union nor the United States can have an interest in an escalation in trade relations."" ""Rather, both the U.S. and the EU would benefit from further deepening trade relations. It is particularly important that the European Union has sought talks with the United States and will continue to do so,"" said Germany's Deputy Government Spokeswoman Martina Fietz in a statement. The German export-oriented economic model is facing a massive attack this year, said Sebastian Heilmann and Guntram Wolff, senior research fellows with Bruegel think tank based in Brussels. ""It should reduce the vulnerability of its export industry by promoting domestic growth and investment in Germany and in Europe. At the same time, Berlin should push for a more ambitious national and European innovation policy as well as a resilient European foreign trade policy,"" said Heilmann and Wolff in a joint article published on Bruegel's website. Meanwhile, French finance and foreign ministries on Tuesday said in a joint statement that ""We agree that there is a problem of overcapacity in steel and aluminum. We are ready to work with the USA and other partners to deal with those issues, and to develop fast and appropriate solutions."" ""But we can only do so serenely when we are certain that we will be excluded from a unilateral increase in tariffs on a permanent basis,"" said the statement. In its statement, the EU said its Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom has been in contact with U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer over the past weeks, and these discussions will continue. But as the flicking-dandruff-off-jacket chemistry between Macron and Trump fades, the following negotiation in the ""final 30 days"" is expected to be bumpy, according to observers. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Gao said the two sides have not yet held any bilateral talks over the U.S. Section 301 investigation and the proposed US tariff list on Chinese goods. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The U.S. Department of Commerce announced a market-shaking decision on Monday to deny export privileges against ZTE, a leading Chinese telecom equipment company. [File photo: China Business News/IC] This was only the latest and one of the many cases of Chinese companies being sanctioned by the United States over the past years. The Trump administration has been accusing China on trade surplus, intellectual property protection and other issues. China's biggest smart phone producer Huawei still can't make a meaningful entry into the United States after decades of efforts, as AT&T and Best Buy rejected or stopped selling Huawei phones weeks ago due to pressure from the administration in the name of ""national security"" concerns. ""National security"" has become a magic tool for the world's biggest developed free market economy to restrict businesses of Chinese companies. While asking China to further open its financial sector, which China did do so gradually based on the reality of its domestic economic development and announced other significant moves recently, the U.S. government blocked China's Ant Financial's acquisition of MoneyGram in January, due to ""national security"" concerns. ""We are disappointed in the termination of this compelling transaction, which would have created significant value for our stakeholders,"" said Alex Holmes, chief executive officer of MoneyGram, noting the geopolitical environment has changed considerably since nearly a year ago. Due to the same reason, China Zhongwang Holdings Limited, an aluminum product manufacturer listed in Hong Kong, also failed to merge U.S. aluminum firm Aleris Corporation, although afterward the U.S. government announced a 10-percent tariff on imported aluminum products, claiming to force foreign companies to build plants in the United States and bring jobs back. Even a Chinese firm of agriculture and animal husbandry had to drop the planned acquisition of U.S. supplier of breeding pigs Waldo Farms, a deal of 16.5 million dollars. Still, it is ""national security"" concerns. In comparison, American companies have profited to great extent from the Chinese market during China's opening up and reform drive in the past four decades, thanks to improving business environment and preferential taxation policies specially designed for foreign investments. In its fiscal year of 2017, Apple, the U.S. biggest cell phone maker, sold 44.8-billion-U.S.-dollar products in China, its largest single market overseas. According to the latest annual report released in September 2017 by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a multi-agency panel that reviews foreign purchases of American companies, China had led foreign countries represented in the CFIUS reviews for the fourth consecutive reported year (2012-2015). Given the surging number of transactions that had been scrutinized by CFIUS and the economic environment between China and the United States in 2016 and 2017, there is no doubt that China will remain on top of the list for a six-year straight streak. However, such opaque and unfair scrutiny by CFIUS has become a main hurdle for Chinese companies to invest in the United States. According to a report jointly released by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations (NCUSCR) and the Rhodium Group last week, Chinese direct investment in the United States fell by more than 35 percent in 2017 due to CFIUS' reviews and China's outbound investment regulatory. The value of newly announced Chinese acquisitions in the United States also plunged by 90 percent from a year earlier and the impact from such decline in investment had been felt on the local level, according to the report. Moreover, the Trump administration and U.S. lawmakers are seeking tighter scrutiny of Chinese investment in the United States through a significant expansion of the CFIUS. This happened at a time when the United States is blaming China for its vast trade deficit while narrowing the door for Chinese investment. China argues that the Chinese people's hard work is part of the reason for China's trade surplus with the United States. A number of facts such as globalization, global division of labor and U.S. dollar's international reserve currency status also play important roles for the surplus. When addressing trade issues, the United States seldom mentions its surplus with China in service sector, and never mentions the U.S. government export controls over China. It is unfair that on one hand the United States restricts the export of high-tech products to China, while on the other it doesn't want China to produce them by itself either. Analysts have said that the U.S. punitive measures taken recently against China are not about trade, but about the impediment of China's development. China is a big developing country, but it's no wonder the country wants to become a developed one, Nobel Prize-winning American economist Joseph Stiglitz said at a panel discussion last week. In the increasingly globalized world, any trade protectionist measures could turn out to be a double-edged sword. The latest U.S. decision on ZTE may hit the Chinese company hard, but the first casualties are its U.S. suppliers. The stock price of ACIA plunged 35.97 percent on Monday, that of Oclaro dropped 15.18 percent, and Lumentum fell by 9.06 percent. >>>Related: Time to start manufacturing chips domestically now The US Commerce Department on Monday banned American companies from selling components to China's telecommunications-gear maker ZTE Corp. With plenty of gadgets, especially chips, purchased from the US, ZTE will suffer heavy losses. The company has already halted trading of its shares in both Hong Kong and Shenzhen, and shares of its US suppliers fell sharply, with some tumbling more than 30 percent. More>>"

""The entire California Almond industry is closely monitoring the recently imposed China tariffs, as China is the U.S.' 3rd largest export market for almonds, with a value of over 500 million U.S. dollars,"" said the Almond Board of California's President and CEO, Richard Waycott, in a statement published in American Journal of Transportation on April 13. The Almond Board of California is an agricultural promotion group represents California Almond growers, processors and handlers. It provides information to members about the expectation of supply and demand each year, as well as monitors and creates marketing campaigns to their customers. ""Unimpeded market access in China and around the globe is essential, as almonds are California's top agricultural export,"" Waycott added. Despite strong warnings from business groups and trade experts, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum last month that could impose tariffs on up to 60 billion U.S. dollars of imports from China, and restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States. Trump also ordered his chief trade negotiator this month to consider imposing tariffs on an additional 100 billion dollars of Chinese products. China vowed to fight back immediately and fiercely without hesitation. U.S. farmers are in the eye of the trade storm and worry that they will be the potential victims in the so-called trade war with China. ""We encourage continued efforts that will ensure that agriculture, within the global trade environment, continues to expand,"" said Waycott, appealing for an avoidance of actions that would jeopardize U.S. agricultural trade with China. ""Global almond trade is fundamental to the long-term well-being of the state by generating over 100,000 jobs across multiple professions, resulting in more than 21 billion U.S. dollars of gross revenue and adding about 11 billion U.S. dollars to the state's economy,"" according to the statement. The U.S. almond industry has been active in China for more than 20 years, with marketing and trade promotion activities. Exports to China, prior to the additional tariff, were anticipated to continue growing at about 6 percent per year, according to the statement of Waycott. ""Market development activities in China have contributed to economic growth in both countries, benefiting California growers and Chinese consumers with a healthy, safe food choice,"" he stressed. California is the world's largest producer of almonds, supplying about 80 percent of the global demand. There are around 6,800 California Almond farms. Of those, 91 percent are family farms. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

China announced a decision to make Hainan island a pilot free trade zone and gradually a free trade port with Chinese characteristics on Friday. A free trade port represents the highest level of opening-up. The landmark decision was immediately followed by a string of measures backing Hainan's efforts to deepen reform and opening-up, released by the central authorities Saturday. China delivers on its promises and vows to significantly broaden market access. The measures include easing foreign equity restrictions in the industries of automobiles, ships and aircraft, significantly lowering the import tariffs for automobiles and reducing import tariffs for some other products. A timetable for further opening the financial sector was also disclosed by central bank governor Yi Gang during the Boao Forum for Asia annual conference in Hainan Province from April 8 to 11. Such major moves to facilitate trade and liberalize investment have been widely appreciated, and will add certainty and momentum to the global economy, which is beset by the headwinds of rising protectionism. They underline the fact that China is committed to further opening up the country to the world through its actions. The new actions in opening-up should put an end to doubts about the country's resolve to continue market-oriented reforms. Obviously, such planned moves have sent a strong message that China is firmly advancing reform and opening up at its own pace. They are also part of efforts to turn the spirit of the 19th Communist Party of China (CPC) National Congress into action. With opening-up a fundamental national policy, China has made significant development achievements over the past 40 years, becoming the world's second largest economy and currently contributing about one-third of world growth. On course to achieving a ""moderately prosperous society"" by 2020 and a great modern socialist country by the middle of the century, China is determined to make new ground in pursuing opening-up on all fronts as the nation pursues high-quality development and develops a modern economy. As this year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up, China will launch a number of landmark opening-up measures. In today's world of multi-polarization and economic globalization, it is right and wise for countries to seek opening-up and win-win cooperation for common development. After all, cutting deficit in peace, development and governance needs development, cooperation and dialogue. A Cold War mentality, unilateralism and protectionism, are all against the tide of history, and bring nothing good to world peace, development or improving global governance. Since its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), China has actively fulfilled its obligations, having cut its overall tariff level from 15.3 percent to 9.8 percent. Yet some WTO members still refuse to meet their own obligation in order to pursue protectionism practice against Chinese exports. A beneficiary, active participant and contributor of globalization, China has no reason to backtrack from opening up. The country will adhere to its path of opening-up to create more opportunities for itself and the world to ""build a community with a shared future for humanity."" Sincerely and seriously, China does what it says in terms of its wider opening. China will never lock itself in a dark room, and the door of its opening-up will only open even wider. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Foreign buyers at this year's Canton Fair in Guangzhou, South China's Guangdong Province, on Sunday Photo: VCG At China's largest and most important trade fair, which opened on Sunday in Guangdong, South China's Guangdong Province, a number of exhibitors said their business has not been affected yet. However, some admitted that if the situation worsens, it might lead to rising costs for their US operations. The 123rd session of China Import and Export Fair, widely known as the Canton Fair, has three phases, and the first phase, focusing on electronics, lasts until Thursday. Zhang Ziyue, a sales assistant for the North America Region for Gree Electric Appliances Inc, said that orders from US customers are stable, although the proposed tariffs announced by the US may affect one of the components in their refrigerators for export. ""It's possible that the price of replacing the particular component for our US customers might rise if the tariffs take effect, thus further affecting our after-sales service in the US, and this is worrying,"" Zhang said. The US is one of their biggest export destinations. ""However, we've mentioned our concerns to our US customers, and they are quite optimistic about the coming situation and haven't cut their orders,"" Zhang said. Feng Liguang, a trade representative for Wangxingda electronic company based in Meizhou, South China's Guangdong Province, which mainly exports sound equipment to overseas markets including the US, said that he cannot see any influence in their US businesses now, but ""we will see at the end of the first phase."" ""The number of buyers from South America and Africa has been increasing in recent years and they are our main customer base now, which is another reason why we are not affected so far,"" Feng said. Yao Shenghua, CEO of Jingsheng Import and Export Company, also said that they are doing business with more buyers from the Middle East and Africa now. ""The truth is, most Chinese companies' export destinations are more diverse; no one puts all their eggs in a single basket now,"" Yao noted. An exhibitor surnamed Chen who runs an auto spare parts company based in Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan Province, noted that most companies are so far not affected because the proposed tariffs have not been implemented yet. ""Some US buyers just visited our booth, and showed an interest in our company's products, easing some of my concerns,"" Chen said, adding that their products are also sold in Europe and Japan. A US buyer, who talked on condition of anonymity, told the Peopleâs Daily on Sunday that the trade connections between China and the US cannot simply be ""cut"" by rising tariffs. He has been coming to the fair for five consecutive years. ""For example, the auto parts, we don't produce them in our country, we have to import from other countries like China. In the end, the rising costs will be paid by the US and Chinese people, which are stupid and will cause losses on both sides,"" he said. More than 200,000 buyers from around 210 countries and regions are expected to visit the fair this year. The number remains stable compared with 2017, though rising unilateralism and protectionism has further complicated the global trade environment, Xu Bing, spokesperson for the Canton Fair and deputy director general of the China Foreign Trade Center, said at a press conference ahead of the fair in Guangzhou on Saturday. While Xu also admitted that there would be some uncertainties on the number of US buyers due to the Sino-US trade tensions, he stressed that buyers from the US are the second-largest group of overseas customers at the fair. ""Chinese exhibitors have already prepared for the situation through optimizing their product structure and actively exploring a diversified market,"" Xu remarked. China's foreign trade reached 6.75 trillion yuan ($1.08 trillion) in the first three months, with export volumes reaching 3.54 trillion yuan, an increase of 9.4 percent and 7.4 percent year-on-year, according to data China's General Administration of Customs released Friday. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The proposed list, which covered approximately 1,300 products imported from China, is based on a so-called Section 301 investigation into alleged Chinese intellectual property and technology transfer practices, launched by the Trump administration in August 2017. The restricted measures launched by the US, mainly targeting at the technology industries such as aerospace, information and communication technology, robotics and machinery, cited the ""Made in China 2025"" strategy, a plan to upgrade the manufacturing sector, as an excuse. But experts found that the trade deficit of the US with China should be blamed to its long-term discriminatory export controls against China as well as strict control over high-tech exports to China. The trade deficit with China of the US would drop 24 to 34 percent if Washington would liberalize its export barriers against China to the same level as those applicable to Brazil or France, said a report released by the US-headquartered think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The deficit could be narrowed if the US eases its restrictions on high-tech exports to China based on consultation, said the report, adding that such move will at the same time satisfy Chinaâs demands for technology upgrade. In the global supply chain that has taken shape, China occupies a seat in some advanced manufacturing sectors, and it is hard to find an alternative in a short run, said Yukon Huang, senior research fellow with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Against such background, the US companies have to pay extra costs for those China-made products and then transferred those expenses to consumers, explained Huang, also former Country Director for China of the World Bank, adding that the US public will be the final victim since their employment and daily life will be affected. A 25-percent tariff on imported Chinese information and communication tech parts and products could slow the growth of US output by $332 billion over the decade, the US-based think tank Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) estimated in a recent report. The US will suffer from less information and communication technology investment, lower creativity, declined productivity and weakened competitiveness as a result of the decision, since tech products constitute a key driver for productivity growth of commodities and service industries, the report concluded. There is no ground to blame technology transfer as along as such trade cooperation is consensual. âWe are in a learning process with them together,â Jochem Heizmann, the chief executive of Volkswagenâs China operations told the New York Times when commenting on transferring technology with Chinaâs electric car industry. âThat process is much faster than we are used to doing these things,â he added. The dilapidated China-US cooperation in aerospace sector can teach the US a lesson. The countryâs government departments had been an objector of bilateral cooperation with a fear that such collaboration may lead to a technology leakage, and as a result put the countryâs technology advantages, especially in military segment, in risks, Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor of National Security Affairs with the US-based Naval War College told Peopleâs Daily. But the business circle expected a closer cooperation with China, in a belief that in this way, they can learn more about Chinaâs advanced technologies and contribute to the mankindâs exploration of outer space based on a sound model of international cooperation, the professor added. The conservative decision makers ultimately gained an upper hand in the debate, leaving narrow room for bilateral cooperation in this field, according to Johnson-Freese. Chinaâs aerospace technology finally advanced in a rapid pace that has gone beyond the expectation of the US, especially with its breakthrough in quantum communication technology. âThe US then hoped to beef up its cooperation with China, but has already missed the best time window,â said Johnson-Freese. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

As the largest economy in Asia, China has made active efforts to propel Asian economic integration, Lin Guijun, vice president of the Beijing-based University of International Business and Economics and also one of the writers of the report, told the Global Times on the sidelines of the forum, which is being held in South China's Hainan Province. As a resource that has propelled the robust development of Asian regional economic integration in recent years, the China-proposed Belt and Road (B&R) initiative has fully displayed China's wisdom and planning, the report said. The B&R initiative is helping to form a pan Euro-Asia group as it gathers many crucial trade partners and is expanding international market increments, Lin said. In 2017, the development dividends as projected by the B&R initiative started to bear fruit, benefiting the countries and regions along the routes. Chinese enterprises have established 56 economic and trade cooperation zones in more than 20 countries, creating $1.1 billion in tariff revenue and 180,000 jobs for these countries. In 2018, China will push forward 10 free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations, kick off 10 FTA feasibility studies and will ensure the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) negotiations will achieve substantial progress. China remains ninth in terms of comprehensive competitiveness among 37 Asian economies in 2017, while its economic vitality is in a leading position in Asia, said the report. Declining interdependence Asian economies continued to lead global growth in 2017, but the region's trade, as well as financial markets, still face challenges due to rising protectionism and uncertainties, according to a report on the progress of Asian economic integration, also released on Sunday by the BFA. ""Asia's trade growth saw modest signs of improvement year-on-year in 2017, but it is far away from its previous golden era. Asian countries' trade interdependence is still seeing a declining trend amid rising global trade protectionism and uncertainties in the global value chain,"" Lin said at the forum. The region's trade self-reliance continued to decline in 2016, with the dependency index dropping to 50.74 percent from 51.48 percent in 2015, said the report. With complicated uncertainties in the region and the world, almost all major Asian economies except South Korea, India, Singapore, Malaysia and the US had reduced their trade dependence on Asia in 2016, it continued. Besides, the region's financial markets also encountered huge challenges, with Asia's financial integration continuing to stagnate, according to the report. There was a trend of capital flight in 2016 due to uncertainty over Asia's future growth and higher economic and political risks, it noted, adding that the 10 largest Asian economies saw $689 billion in capital outflows, an obvious contrast to inflows of $570 billion. Collective approach Against this backdrop, experts called for coordinated efforts by Asian economies to cope with protectionist pressures from Western countries and to bolster faster economic growth in Asia. Zhou Wenzhong, secretary-general of the BFA, was quoted as saying in the second report that Asia should work collectively to develop a common approach to external pressures both on the macroeconomic side and in trade to reverse the trend of ""flight to safety"" and to resist protectionist pressures from Western developed countries. Asia should also work out clear policies to deal with structural changes to the global value chain, innovative ways to grow, and should spare no efforts to deepen the financial reforms of individual economies in a coordinated manner, Zhou noted.

Global companies, which have long been the beneficiaries from close economic ties between China and the United States, are set to lose from escalating trade disputes. Almost 60 percent of the China's trade surplus with the United States is a result of trade activities by foreign-funded enterprises, including many U.S. companies. A recent report by the American Chamber of Commerce in South China said that U.S. firms rely much on Chinese imports to generate profits. A substantial share of Chinese imports is sourced by U.S. companies, many of which source much, most, or in some cases nearly all of the goods they sell from China, not just for the U.S. market, but for global markets, according to the report. Many U.S. firms that have operations in China have already expressed their worries over escalated trade tensions. ""The world is interdependent and the cost of trade wars is too high, with a negative impact to the global economy,"" commodity trader Cargill Inc. said. In addition to potential losses to U.S. firms, the negative effects would spill over to multinationals based in other countries. ""A tariff war between the U.S. and China could not only cut down on trade between the two nations but can affect countries like Japan, which for example exports parts to China to be assembled and sent to the U.S.,"" the Japan Times quoted Kenji Yumoto, vice chairman of the Japan Research Institute, as saying. Global financial markets were also hit hard in fear of intensified trade tensions. The U.S. stocks plunged on Friday, with all three major indices tumbling over 2 percent, after the U.S. side threatened additional duties on Chinese goods worth 100 billion U.S. dollars Thursday. Uneasy sentiment also brought almost all major global indices lower, with the FTSE 100 index, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, and the DAX index all losing ground the previous trading day. ""A trade war would be in no one's interests,"" said a Standard Chartered report, adding that a trade war could affect 20 percent of the global economy. In the long term, the U.S. tariff proposals, which contravene the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, undermine the trade system that has evolved in the last three quarters of a century. While advocating a market environment for fair competition, the WTO paid a lot of attention to ""relative equality"" by taking into consideration the development difference of developing and developed countries when trade rules were formulated. China and the United States are the biggest developing and biggest developed countries in the world, respectively. Bilateral economic and trade relationship is an inevitable result of international industrial division and distribution of resources under the backdrop of globalization. The development of China-U.S. economic and trade relations should continue to follow the historical logic and abide by the well acknowledged WTO rules, instead of breaking them. Otherwise, by disrupting the rules, it could have a long lasting impact on the global supply chain. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The country on Wednesday unveiled a list of products worth $50 billion imported from the US that will be subject to higher tariffs, including soybeans, automobiles, aircraft and chemical products. The decision, made by the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council, involved a possible additional tariff of 25 percent on 106 items of products under 14 categories. It was a counter-measure taken after the US administration announced a proposed list of products subject to additional tariffs, which covers Chinese exports worth $50 billion. The arrogant Uncle Sam obviously has underestimated the negative impacts to be placed on itself by the trade war, and now is the time for it to learn from reality. The protectionism show put on by the US has drawn it worldwide resistance. With the announcement of the proposed tariff list of Chinese goods based on the so-called Section 301 investigation, the US is telling the world that it is betraying its own promises, and trampling on the international trade rules. When approving the Marrakesh Agreement in 1994, the then US President, in a commitment to the congress, promised not to use Section 301 investigation to judge whether a foreign country violates WTO rules. The country once again pledged in 1998 to settle trade disputes based on WTO procedures after the EU filed a complaint to the WTO over the Section 301 investigation. Years later, the US slapped in the face of itself by threatening China with unilateral trade sanctions without any approval from the global trade body. The US has never stopped discrediting China by blaming it and other trade partners for its own troubles like trade deficits and rising unemployment. What is more inexplicable is that the worldâs largest economy always labels itself as a âvictimâ of international cooperation. But it is well-known that the true intention behind its delusional disorder is to maximize its own interests by finding excuses for unilateral sanctions. In order to hide its motives, it created some groundless excuses for its provocation. Such unreasonable move to blame others for its internal affairs indicated that the US has gone further along the wrong track. For instance, it declared that the rise of Chinese manufacturing has hurt the interests of the US, but facts proved that such accusation cannot hold water at all. The manufacturing jobs in the US have been shrinking for consecutive 65 years. The segment contributed 8.5 percent to all jobs in the US in 2017, falling from 32 percent in 1953. The figure had already dropped to 12 percent when China joined WTO in 2001. The variation of manufacturing jobs is resulted from the huge influence of technology reforms and the increasing globalization of the supply chain, pointed out senior research fellow Stephen Roach at Yale University, adding that the US should rather find a cure to its own economic imbalance and decreasing vitality than to put the blame on the others. In addition, it is ridiculous persecutory delusion that the Uncle Sam attributed Chinaâs technology innovation to âforced technology transferâ. Foreign investment in China is totally market-based voluntary activities, and China has no such laws that require foreign companies to transfer their technologies to Chinese partners. China is unswervingly implementing an innovation-driven development strategy. Its âMade in China 2025â strategy, a plan to upgrade the manufacturing sector, will help transform the country from a manufacturing giant into a manufacturing powerhouse. But its improvement in innovation and manufacturing capabilities is not aimed to beat or replace the US, but to create better lives for its own people and bring more benefits for the world. The US is trying to curb the progress of Chinaâs high-tech industries by creating more trade barriers, but such ill-disposed approach is doomed to fail, while making itself miss shots in economic and scientific progresses. Industrial giants such as General Electric and Goldman Sachs, as well as some agricultural enterprises have expressed their concerns that the US may lose the golden chance to be involved in the most profitable and fastest-growing market given the additional tariffs and investment restrictions. US technology and investment industries agreed that the US government hopes to help them out, but what it does might lead to irreversible damage to their supply chain established after decades of efforts. The US has to understand that no country could be scapegoat of its economic headache. If the US bends on waging a trade war at the cost of loss to both sides, China has the capability and determination to fight to the end. China also has the sincerity if the US wants to sit down for a talk, but everything must be based on equal consultation and mutual respect. China will never surrender to the irrationality of the US in the trade war, and the only way for the US to reduce loss is to slam on the brakes. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"
227,http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2018/0408/c90000-9446724.html,Opinion: Risks of a US-China trade war,"April 08, 2018","In his inaugural address a little over a year ago, Donald Trump asserted that ââ¦ protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.â The Trump Administration has subsequently moved from rhetoric to action in its avowed campaign to defend US workers from what the President calls the âcarnage of terrible trade deals.â And, as indicated by a series of tariff actions announced in early 2018, China is clearly the target. Trump has long believed that China was responsible for pressures squeezing American workers. The evidence: academic research on the so-called âChina shock,â in conjunction with Chinaâs outsize portion of a gaping US trade deficit. The 2016 campaign mantra of âMaking America Great Againâ became a call to action for the 45th President of the United States. China is seen as the means toward that end â as a threat to the renaissance of a once dominant US manufacturing sector. This argument is seriously flawed. US manufacturing employment has been on a steady downtrend for 65 years â falling from 32 percent of total employment in 1953 to 8.5 percent in 2017. By the time China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001, this portion had already plummeted to 12 percent, reflecting the powerful secular forces of technological change and increasingly globalized supply chains. In 2017, fully 47 percent of the total US merchandise trade deficit of nearly $800 billion was with China. Significantly, new data from the OECD and the World Trade Organization suggests at least 40 percent of this bilateral imbalance reflects supply chain effects of components and parts that are produced outside of China but assembled inside China. That means based on the value added actually produced in China â the essence of the alleged China threat â the 47 percent share of the US deficit would be reduced to around 28 percent. This is still a big number. But it is far below the claims of President Trump and the official figures of the US Department of Commerce. While the international specialization of comparative advantage explains this outsize portion, that argument doesnât matter in the political arena. Politicians, have no patience for statistical analysis â they find it much easier to blame others and point the finger at China. But there is far more serious flaw to Washingtonâs fixation on the US-China bilateral trade imbalance. The United States ran merchandise trade deficits with 102 nations in 2017. This reflects Americaâs profound shortfall of domestic saving â a net national saving rate (depreciation-adjusted saving of businesses, households, and the government sector, combined) of just 1.8 percent in 2017, less than one-third the 6.3 percent average in the final three decades of the 20th century. Lacking in domestic saving and wanting to consume and grow, America must import surplus saving from abroad and run massive current-account and multilateral trade deficits to attract the foreign capital. That leads to one of the great ironies of an anti-China US trade strategy: Going after China, without addressing the root cause of low saving, is like squeezing one end of a water balloon â the water sloshes to the other end. In effect, the Chinese piece of the US trade deficit would be redistributed to other, higher-cost foreign producers. That is the functional equivalent of a tax hike on the very middle class the Trump Administration is trying to protect. Moreover, this problem looks to get worse. In the aftermath of a $1.5 trillion ten-year tax cut and follow-up actions by the US Congress to add another $300 billion to the federal deficit in order to prevent a government shutdown, pressures on domestic saving and the trade deficit will only intensify. In this context, protectionist policies will pose an increasingly serious threat to Americaâs already-daunting external funding requirements â putting pressure on US interest rates, the dollarâs exchange rate, or both. While Chinaâs response to Trump Administration tariffs has been modest to date, more meaningful retaliation can hardly be ruled out. As Americaâs third largest and most rapidly growing major export market, and as the biggest foreign holder of US Treasury securities, China has considerable leverage at its disposal. Yet there are no winners in trade wars. Three initiatives should be considered to avoid such an endgame: One, the exchange of views between the US and China is far too episodic â annual gatherings of the Strategic and Economic Dialogs, Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, as well as periodic leader-to-leader summits. A permanent secretariat, staffed by high-level experts from both sides, would be far more effective in tackling the complexity of a challenging relationship on an ongoing basis. Two, both nations should put a high priority on breaking the 10-year logjam in negotiations of a bilateral investment treaty. For US multinationals, access to Chinaâs rapidly expanding domestic markets is a major growth opportunity. The same is the case for Chinaâs âGoing Outâ global investment campaign. Three, the thorny issue of technology transfer â the essence of the battle over intellectual property rights â needs to be resolved. In doing so, an important distinction needs to be made between contractual sharing of operating systems by partners in commercially-negotiated joint ventures and outright theft, coercion, and cyberhacking. In todayâs knowledge-based world, there can be no higher priority. In the 1930s, protectionist tariffs and a global trade war exacerbated the Great Depression and destabilized the international order. Sadly, one of the most painful lessons of modern history is now at risk of being ignored.

The US government announced on Tuesday a proposed list of 1,300 products subject to a suggested tariff of 25 percent, worth $50 billion. China struck back with a tariff plan of equal scale, with a list of U.S. products including soybeans, automobiles and aircraft. On April 6, China gave a stronger response to the U.S. proposal for additional tariffs on a list of 100-billion-U.S. dollar Chinese products. U.S. soybean future dropped following the release of Chinaâs countermeasures. Although the U.S. is a main supplier of soybeans to China, the soybeans are not irreplaceable. Statistics indicate that Brazil is the largest source of soybeans to China, while U.S. soybeans exported to China account for 62 percent of its total. The U.S. aircraft industry will also suffer a lot from the countermeasures, which may cause not only Chinaâs cancellation of orders for several thousand Boeing airplanes, in addition it may bring about the transfer of the global aircraft manufacturing industry chain to Europe and Asia. What the U.S. will lose is not only orders, employment and profits, but also this future potential in the aircraft industry. Moreover, the countermeasures directly attacked the U.S. automobile industry. The price for U.S. automobiles exported to China will rise by 20 percent after the tariffs are slapped on. The competitiveness of the U.S. automobile industry, therefore, will fall sharply, and China will increase orders for automobiles from European and Asian countries. More importantly, slapping tariffs on imports of U.S. automobiles will stimulate development of Chinaâs automobile industry. The proposed tariff list based on the Section 301 investigation mainly involves Chinaâs high-tech industries including aerospace, information and communication technologies, robotics, pharmaceuticals and machinery. The investigation was initiated in the name of protecting intellectual property rights, while the truth is that China did not adopt U.S. technologies in neither its aerospace nor information or communications industries. The U.S. has ulterior motives in starting the trade war. Its purpose is to curb Chinaâs implementation of the strategy of âMade in China 2025â and its development of high-tech industries. Nevertheless, the trick will not succeed after all, as the development of Chinaâs emerging sectors, also Chinaâs competitive industries involved in the strategy, will not be contained by these tariffs. Chinaâs economic structure has been successfully transformed. Its service sector has surpassed its industry to be the locomotive of Chinaâs economic growth. The country, which has been deepening reform and opening up, is also easing access to the service sector in the regards of finance, education, health care as well as the telecom industries. However, the financial sector, as the core industry and economic lifeline of the U.S., will be likely to lose the opportunity of entering the worldâs largest market of China because of the trade war. The stirring up of a trade war initiated from the U.S. side will not only harm American peopleâs livelihood, it will also result in failure for enterprises to share benefits brought about by Chinaâs growth Today, the U.S. is undoubtedly kicking down the ladder after its economy just recovered from the financial crisis in 2008, when China contributed more than half to global economic growth at the height of the financial crisis. Without China, it may be have been difficult for the U.S. to get out of that crisis at the time. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The U.S. has been trying to obstruct Chinaâs fast development, as Chinaâs economic achievements have caused U.S. anxiety. Most of the tariffs are targeting Chinaâs high-tech industries, which are crucial for the countryâs future development,â Peopleâs Daily Online reported in a commentary on Sunday. According to the commentary, Chinaâs scientific development has been booming in recent years despite U.S. high-tech export control towards China, and China has the confidence to tackle any unjust tariffs from the U.S. âIf the White House wants to launch an even bigger trade war against us, we have only one response, that is we are not afraid of you,â the commentary added. Though criticizing China for not abiding by WTO rules and intellectual theft, statistics from the WTO indicate that as of 2017, China is involved in 40 international trade disputes, while the number for the U.S. is 137. ""These tariffs that have targeted China confirm that the Trump administration intends to bypass the WTO's dispute settlement body and rely on U.S. law unilaterally regarding the ongoing trade dispute with China. That is a big mistake,"" according to R. Taylor, a political science professor at the University of St. Thomas in Houston, Texas, which he told Xinhua on Saturday. The unjust tariffs have also evoked criticism from foreign political figures and the public. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who called China a pillar of the multilateral system, told Xinhua that trade wars are always bad for those involved and for the international economy as a whole, while Martin Wansleben, chief executive of the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said that new tariffs and trade barriers not only inflict additional costs on companies and consumers but also hurt innovation. In response to the tariffs, the Chinese government has been reiterating its stance on negotiation while also noting that the country is not afraid of a trade war. According to a statement from Chinaâs Ministry of Commerce on Friday, the country will fight at any cost and take comprehensive countermeasures if the U.S. continues its unilateral and protectionist practices, while on the same day, Chinaâs ministry of foreign affairs stressed that China will not hesitate to fight back fiercely. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Tension between the world's two largest economies reached a new height after the U.S. side threatened additional duties on Chinese goods worth 100 billion U.S. dollars Thursday. China, hours later, said it will ""fight till the end at any cost"" and take ""comprehensive countermeasures."" This has been the third round of trade fire exchange between the two economic giants, all of which were initiated by the U.S. side. In the first two rounds, the United States slapped tariff on steel and aluminum imports from countries including China, as well as additional tariffs on Chinese imports worth 50 billion U.S. dollars, to which China responded firmly with tariff plans of equal weight. For the latest U.S. protectionist move, China also demonstrated full readiness to fight back ""fiercely"" with detailed countermeasures in the pipeline. ""We don't want a trade war, but we are not afraid of it,"" said China's Ministry of Commerce (MOC) Friday. Though details of the possible options were yet to be revealed, the country has hinted that all options are possible regarding the escalating situation. ""We are not taking any options off the table,"" Gao Feng, spokesperson with the MOC, said at a press briefing Friday. He Weiwen, an executive council member of the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies, said China still has many cards still up in its sleeve. Petroleum and liquid natural gas could be the possible options for future tariff hike if trade tension mounts, as China is the largest regional buyer of these U.S. products, according to him. As the world's second largest economy, China should not be threatened by the United States, he said, noting that China's countermeasures of equal scale will produce equal effect on the United States. In the previous trade fire exchange, U.S. products such as soybeans, automobiles, aircraft and chemical products have already been on the list of China's reciprocative tariff plan. ""I have to say that we were forced to take countermeasures, and we have reacted with restraint,"" Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen told reporters. Wang Xiaosong, a professor with Renmin University, said China's announced countermeasures have already hit the United States' tender spot, as U.S. products like soybean and aircraft are highly dependent on the Chinese market. U.S. soybeans sold to China account for 62 percent of its total soybean exports, with 32.85 million tonnes of soybeans exported to China in 2017, or 34.39 percent of China's total imports. ""With all the domestic industries united as one, China is stronger in economic resilience,"" Wang said. If trade tension escalates, China still has plenty of countermeasures at disposal and room for maneuver. Meanwhile, simulation calculations have shown that the U.S. trade bashing will not be a threat on China, and China is fully capable of bearing the consequences brought by a trade war, according to Li Chunding, an associate research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao also reiterated earlier that China will not surrender to external pressure.

The date of implementation will depend on when the U.S. government imposes the tariffs on Chinese products, according to the Ministry of Finance."

Sheridan Titman, professor in the department of finance, University of Texas at Austin, said if the tension worsened into a trade war, it would hurt the U.S. agricultural sector badly. ""We export a lot of agricultural products to China,"" Titman said. ""If I were running trade for China, I would buy less soybeans from the U.S. and more from Brazil and Argentina."" Steven M. Rashba, professor of business communication at the University of Bridgeport, said American farmers and workers are the ones to be seriously affected by the tariffs. ""The people who will truly suffer are American farmers and factory workers -- the people he (U.S. President Donald Trump) claims to be helping. The implications for the economy are enormous and frightening."" Rashba said ordinary Americans have already tasted the bitterness of the ongoing trade tension. The U.S. dollar declined against most other major currencies in late trading on Wednesday. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six peers, decreased 0.07 percent at 90.139 in late trading. Oil prices also retreated on Wednesday as trade tensions between the two countries dampened investor sentiment. The U.S. administration on Tuesday announced a proposed list of products subject to additional tariffs, which covers Chinese exports worth 50 billion dollars with a suggested tariff of 25 percent. China on Wednesday hit back at the U.S. unilateral action with its own tariff plan. It unveiled a list of products imported from the United States worth 50 billion dollars that will be subject to higher tariffs. The items include soybeans, automobiles and chemical products. China's Customs Tariff Commission has decided to impose additional tariffs of 25 percent on 106 items under 14 categories. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

If the Trump administration imposes $60 billion in tariffs on Chinese commodities, the move will influence all Americans, pointed out New York Daily News in a recent report. The US National Retail Federation shared the same opinion in an open letter to President Donald Trump. Over 41 percent of clothes, 72 percent of shoes and 84 percent of travel goods in the US market are made in China. Increased tariffs on these products are tantamount to adding more taxes on customers, said the letter. At present, customers can buy a large box of Easter eggs tagged with âmade in Chinaâ costing only $14.99 at Walmart in Virginia. However, itâs uncertain whether the eggs will be more expensive next year, an adult from a less well-off family shopping at the supermarket for festive eggs with two daughters told the journalist. Taking an electronic product as another example,  a 1-meter long data cable for iPhones is sold $19 at the Apple store. Identical products with the same features made by Anke, a Chinese manufacturer, only cost American consumers $7.99. They are sold on Amazon as well as at some physical chain stores such as Walmart, Ikea and Best Buy, said Peopleâs Daily. Many interviewees agreed that prices of such commodities will rise as the new tariff policy is carried out, but itâs in fact the Americans that will pay for the consequences. For the whole year in 2017, the US imported 2.38 billion pairs of shoes worth over $25 billion while its domestic manufacturers only made 25 million pairs, according to statistics from Footwear Distributors and Retailers Association (FDRA) in the US, adding that the number of imported shoes made in China amounted to 1.7 billion in 2017, worth $14 billion. The Association noted that a pair of Nike sneakers sold at $160 will rise to $200 or a higher price if the tariffs increase. Erik, a senior manager and also gym fan has sports shoes that are mostly made in China and cost around $100, said he plans to buy fewer new shoes if the prices go up. A large quantity of imported Chinese commodities boasting good quality and lower prices flow to Walmart customers. If there will indeed be sweeping rises in price over daily necessities such as clothes and bedding, the low income and middle income households will face more substantial increase of living expenses than other classes, said Senior Fellow Chad Bown at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), a US private research institution. China and the US have established a close economic and trade relationship in the past 40 years. The trade war will be damaging for both countries, said Richard Cooper, Professor of International Economics at Harvard University. He noted that any kind of trade war can affect US households and also importers of intermediate products from China. Taking steel as an example, steel is not used by final consumers, but high tariffs will hurt downstream users. The new tariff policy will cause hundreds of thousands of job losses in the US, according to United States Global Partners (USGP), an international trading and business consulting company based in the US. The consulting company noted that over 26,000 new jobs in the steel and aluminum industries will be created after more tariffs are levied on imported Chinese products, but a far larger number of almost 500,000 employees from related industries, such as aviation, auto manufacturing, construction and electronic components will lose their jobs owing to rising costs. Back to 2002, then US President George W Bush announced an increase of 8 to 30 percent tariffs added to Chinese steel products entering the US, but the move failed to stimulate employment and ended one and a half years later. Trade cooperation requires both sides to reach for a common background, instead of acting in its own way, said Rudy Vetter, chief marketing officer for Green Card Fund, an Arizona-based group that connects foreign investors and developers. Public figures with vision from both countries believe that China and the US have been economically intertwined. Cooperation leads to mutual benefits while confrontation will only hurt both sides. Vetterâs opinion echoes a commonly agreed upon philosophy. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Wente Vineyards, a winery in Livermore Valley in the San Francisco Bay Area in northern California, has recently suspended the shipment of 5,000 cases of wine destined for China. Part of the reason is the importers in China would prefer to wait and see how the tariff implementation plays out, according to the winery, about an hour's ride from San Francisco. The importers would also like to see how Chinese consumers perceive the U.S. products and how it influences their immediate buying habits, said Michael Parr, vice president of international sales at Wente Family Estates, on Wednesday. ""We hope that diplomacy and negotiation efforts between U.S.A. and China will step up soon to avoid escalation of these unfair trade barriers,"" he said. Compared with Wente, Klinker Brick Winery in Lodi city in California Central Valley was luckier. It had already shipped 1,000 cases of wine to Shenzhen in southern China last week. It's the first time that the winery has ever exported wine to China. But the new tariff will pose a major challenge for Klinker Brick's journey into the Chinese market. China started the retaliatory tariffs of between 15 percent and 25 percent on 2.75 billion U.S. dollars worth of U.S. imports, including wine, nuts and pork, in response to steep duties on aluminum and steel announced by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. California farmers call the tariffs ""a blow"" to their business. The Chinese market is developing rapidly and it has huge potential of imported wine consumers, said Pat Patrick, president and CEO of Lodi Chamber of Commerce. Lodi is a major wine production area in the U.S., with 100,000 acres of wine grapes and about 100 wineries. China is expected to surpass the U.K. as the world's second largest wine market by 2020, driven by the growing middle class and the millennial generation, and China proves to be an exciting market as the California wine industry has seen a growing interest from Chinese consumers, said Patrick. ""The Chinese consumers trust American products because they are of top quality,"" said Patrick. But he said they would have to wait and see if the Chinese consumers were willing to pay more for the U.S. wines. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The tariff announced by China on Sunday will slap an extra 25 percent on U.S. products, which took effect on Monday. China's move came in response to U.S. President Donald Trump administration's unilateral plan to impose steep tariffs on Chinese imports of aluminum and steel announced last month. In Oregon, the tariffs would apply to such agricultural products as hazelnuts, pears, berries, apples and wine, said The Register-Guard, a daily newspaper formed in 1930 and published in Eugene, Oregon in the western United States. ""Our assumption is there will be some effect,"" it quoted Alexis Taylor, director of the Oregon Department of Agriculture, as saying. The paper said China is Oregon's fourth-largest importer of agriculture products, behind South Korea, Canada and Japan. ""In 2017, Oregon sent more than 320 million U.S. dollars in agricultural products to China, including Hong Kong,"" said the paper, quoting the data of Euromonitor, a global market research company. According to the state's agriculture department, Oregon leads the nation in hazelnut production, accounting for nearly 100 percent of U.S. output, and about 60 percent of Oregon's crop is exported, with Asian and European nations buying much of the harvest. China said it would impose a 15 percent tariff on hazelnuts, also called filberts, along with several other U.S. farm products on Sunday. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The decision was made by the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council, involving a possible additional tariff of 25 percent on 106 items of products under 14 categories, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on its website. The move was taken after the U.S. administration announced a proposed list of products subject to additional tariffs, which covers Chinese exports worth 50 billion dollars with a suggested tariff rate of 25 percent. ""The date of implementation will depend on when the U.S. government imposes the tariffs on Chinese products,"" the MOF said. PRODUCTS INVOLVED The U.S.-proposed list covers approximately 1,300 products imported from China from industries such as aerospace, information and communication technology, robotics and machinery, the Office of U.S. Trade Representative said in a statement. The proposed tariff list is based on a Section 301 investigation into alleged Chinese intellectual property and technology transfer practices launched by the U.S. administration in August 2017. In response, China's list includes a wide variety of agricultural products such as soybeans, corn, beef, orange juice and tobacco. U.S. soybeans sold to China account for 62 percent of its total soybean exports, with 32.85 million tonnes of soybeans exported to China in 2017, or 34.39 percent of China's total imports, Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said at a press conference. While U.S. farmers can get the benefits from healthy Sino-U.S. economic ties, the export amount to China was ""too big,"" he said. Chinese farmers have petitioned industry associations, claiming that U.S. subsidies hurt the interests of Chinese soybean growers, and China must respect its farmers' demands, Zhu said. ""That's why soybeans became one of our choices as a countermeasure,"" he added. China was forced to bring forward the product list, and there are grounds for the specific items and their order on the list, Zhu said. A range of chemicals and automobiles, as well as certain aircraft, will also be subject to the tariffs, according to the list. The Boeing 737 narrow body jet falls under the description and may have to face additional tariffs when entering China. Boeing's shares plunged more than 4 percent in premarket trading Wednesday. REACTION WITH ""RESTRAINT"" ""Disregarding serious representations by China, the United States announced tariff proposals that are completely unfounded, a typical unilateralist and protectionist practice that China strongly condemns and firmly opposes,"" the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) said on its website. The U.S. move was ""an evident violation of rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO),"" the MOC said. Its measures ""severely infringed on the legitimate rights and interests that China enjoys in accordance with the WTO rules, and threatened China's economic interests and security,"" the MOC said. New tariffs China decided to impose on U.S. products were a reaction to ""the emergency caused by the U.S. violation of international obligations,"" it added. China has filed a request for consultations under the WTO dispute settlement framework over the U.S.-proposed list, the MOC said in a separate statement. ""China is an active participant, firm supporter and an important contributor in multilateral trade mechanisms,"" said the statement, citing an unnamed spokesperson. ""We hope and believe that the WTO dispute settlement body will deal with the case in an objective and just manner to safeguard rule-based international trade order,"" the spokesperson said. The economies of China and the United States are highly complementary, and ""cooperation is the only right choice for the two countries,"" the MOF said. Since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1979, bilateral trade has surged more than 230 times to 580 billion dollars in 2017, data showed. ""I have to say that we were forced to take countermeasures, and we have reacted with restraint,"" Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen told reporters. Both countries should stay rational, enhance communication and manage differences in a constructive manner, according to the MOF. They should seek constructive measures to deal with problems and challenges so as to bring bilateral economic ties back to a healthy and stable track, Zhu said. China does not want a trade war, as there will be no winners, according to Wang. ""But we are also not afraid of it.

The proposed list covers approximately 1,300 products imported from China, worth around 50 billion U.S. dollars of annual trade value,including industries such as aerospace, information and communication technology, robotics and machinery, the USTR's Office said in a statement. The list, which will undergo further review in a public notice and comment process, is based on a so-called Section 301 investigation into alleged Chinese intellectual property and technology transfer practices, launched by the Trump administration in August 2017. The Chinese Embassy in the United States in response said the Chinese side ""strongly condemns and firmly opposes"" the unfounded Section 301 investigation and the proposed list of products and tariff increases. ""Such unilateralistic and protectionist action has gravely violated fundamental principles and values of the WTO. It serves neither China's interest, nor U.S. interest, even less the interest of the global economy,"" the Chinese embassy said in a statement. The Chinese side will resort to the WTO to settle the dispute and take corresponding measures of ""equal scale and strength"" against U.S. products in accordance with Chinese law, said the embassy. The proposed tariff list ""appears to mostly target intermediate goods,"" which would ""harm U.S. manufactures who are sourcing from Chinese suppliers,"" Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Xinhua. Business groups from China and the United States in recent weeks have warned the Trump administration not to move forward its tariff plan on Chinese imports, as it would raise the costs for American consumers and companies as well as having a negative effect on the financial markets. ""Imposing taxes on products used daily by American consumers and job creators is not the way"" to address trade issues between the United States and China, Myron Brilliant, executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said Tuesday in a statement.

The Information Technology Industry Council, a Washington D.C.-based technology industry trade group, also said the proposed tariffs would ""penalize U.S. consumers by increasing prices on technology products."" ""If history is any indication, these proposed tariffs will not work and will be entirely counterproductive,"" the trade group said Tuesday in a statement. Max Baucus, a former senator from the U.S. state of Montana and U.S. ambassador to China, said American farmers ""are going to get squeezed"" by the tariff proposal ""from all sides."" ""First, the tariffs the U.S. announced today will make the (agricultural) equipment and inputs they rely on more expensive. Then they'll face new tariffs on their exports when China retaliates,"" said Baucus, who now serves as the co-chairman of the farm lobbying group Farmers for Free Trade.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said last week that it would go through a 60-day comment period after the administration released the proposed tariff list and ""there's hope"" that trade talks between the United States and China could lead to a fruitful outcome.

Trump wants foreigners to invest more in the US, and American firms to bring jobs back to the country, Richard Cooper, a professor of international economy at Harvard University told Peopleâs Daily in a recent interview, adding that the President also wants to reduce the current trade deficit. However, all these great things are incompatible, and thatâs part of the problems of the US economic and trade strategy, added Cooper, who is also former chairman of National Intelligence Council and under-secretary of state. Cooperâs comments came after Trump signed a memorandum that could impose heavy tariffs on Chinese exports to the US last month, claiming that this policy will help narrow trade deficit with China. The measure wonât take any effects, the economist made it clear, explaining that China as a WTO member has the rights under the WTO rules. If the Trump administration does impose more tariffs on Chinese commodities, most of the US imports will move to Bangladesh, Vietnam and a number of other countries, he expounded, concluding that levying heavy tariffs will certainly not reduce the US total trade deficit. The professor said an answer should be asked that is the US really going to implement relevant policies and whatâs the legal basis for that. Trumpâs trade policy will face many uncertainties and strong resistance, he said, adding that there have been oppositions from the Republican Party and business community in the US. The President and his administration will have to deal with these oppositions despite of his personal inclination, Cooper said, pointing out that the Trump trade policies are different from that of former US administrations. All the US administrations in the past several decades starting from the Johnson administration have engaged in some tariff moves. The other Presidents, like Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, were still committed to an open trading environment though they all engaged in some âtemporaryâ or âspecialâ tariff increases, Cooper said. He added that Trumpâs rhetoric differs significantly from all of his predecessors in the last decades. The latest protectionist US President may be Herbert Hoover, who promoted typical trade protectionism during his reign. âThe trade war will be damaging for both countriesâ, the professor stressed, saying it can affect the US households, and also importers of intermediate products from China. Taking steel as an example, steel is not used by final consumers, but high tariffs will hurt downstream users. China has its rights, but if its rights are not respected under the framework of the WTO, the country will surely take actions, Cooper added. Cooper, who is teaching subjects related to Chinese economy at Harvard University, has been keeping an eye on Chinaâs development. Serving the Carter administration in 1970s to 1980s, he witnessed US-China interactions such as the negotiations of whether to grant most favored nation trade status to China. Back to 1980, no one believed that the China-US trade could reach such a large scale, or even whoever says China will become what it is today would be laughed at that time, the professor said. Reviewing history, one can find that giving China permanent normal trading relations with the US and supporting Chinaâs bid for WTO membership have benefited both countries, he added. Although the trade conflict between the two countries is watched by many people, Cooper personally sees China as an economic partner for US in the future because cooperation serves the interests of both countries. Problems arise when economic transactions, trades and capital movements between two countries rise, the professor pointed out. Citing the example of Canada, who used to be the biggest trading partner of the US, Cooper said that there were also a large number of disputes on trade between the two countries, but they treated each dispute one by one and these disputes didnât affect the overall relationship between Canada and the US. The professor believes itâs not surprising that trade conflicts have gone up between China and the US as the trade and cooperation have gone up, and the challenge for both is to deal with trade disputes item by item in a rational manner. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Gao reiterated the stance in response to the doubts over Chinaâs âlower-than-expectedâ market access, which is believed to be one of the reasons for the US to launch the Section 301 investigation against China. Gaoâs statement was echoed by many other scholars and experts. âSince Chinaâs entrance to the WTO, the country has taken proactive measures to fulfill its commitment,â said Lian Ping, chief economist of the Bank of Communications, citing its efforts to open banking, securities, and insurance markets and historic achievements in the financial sector as evidence. China has now become the worldâs largest exporter and the second largest importer. It also remains the top investment destination among developing countries and a major source of outbound investment. Data shows that China has lowered its overall tariff level from 15.3% at the time of its accession to 9.8% in accordance with WTO rules, delivering on its promises to all WTO members and over-fulfilling the organizationâs requirements for developing countries. âTaking the trade structure into consideration, China's trade-weighted average tariff rate is standing at 4.4%, on par with the rates of developed countries, such as 2.4% in the US, 3% in the EU and 4% in Australia,â said Gao. China promised to open up 100 of the WTO's 160 sub-sectors when accessing the organization, and so far it has opened 120 of them, said Vice Minister Wang Shouwen. âAs a matter of fact, to fulfill the promises is just a part of Chinaâs efforts to expand its openness,â said Li Guanghui, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, the think tank under the Ministry of Commerce. By continuously improving investment and market environment, speeding up the pace of opening up and lowering the operational costs of markets, China has created a more stable, equal-footed, transparent and predictable business environment, he added. Last year, China unveiled 20 measures to further open up the economy to foreign investment and set up another 7 pilot free trade zones (FTZ) including the one in northeast Liaoning province. Now the country has 11 pilot FTZs, forming an opening-up network encompassing the whole territory. The country also announced to remove 27 restrictions on foreign investment in a newly issued negative list for its free-trade zones. In addition, the catalogue for the guidance of foreign investment industries released by the Ministry of Commerce also cut 30 special administrative measures restricting foreign investment, from 93 in the previous version. The string of measures adopted by the US regarding trade policies on China is a result of typical protectionism, Cold-war mentality and zero-sum game, Gao stressed, adding that the US should not blame on China groundlessly. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

""Disregarding strong representations by China, the United States announced the tariff proposals that are completely unfounded, a typical unilateralist and protectionist practice that China strongly condemns and firmly opposes,"" according to the statement.

The move went against the interests of China, the United States and the world at large, seriously violating the basic principles and spirit of the World Trade Organization, according to the spokesperson.

The tariffed American goods will value to $3 billion based on statistics in 2017. Before the decision became official, it was supported by the Chinese public, with a lot of people mailing or calling the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) to show their support. Some of them even suggested that the measures should be tougher at the time when the ministry was soliciting public opinions, said a spokesperson of the MOC. Li Yong, president of China Association of International Trade, said Chinaâs retaliatory measures were taken according to the principle of reciprocity under the trade rules of the World Trade Organization. The list of items does not cover larger-scale US products, indicating both Chinaâs restraint and determination for retaliation, Li said. A Carrefour store in eastern Beijing has not yet raised prices of US fruits and nuts as of April 2. The domestic supplier, based in Guangzhou, said it will communicate with the US supplier about strategic price adjustments. âWe havenât raised our prices on the first day of tariff increases. We are negotiating with our US suppliers, hoping they could make some compromises,â said a marketing manager of the company surnamed Huang. Huang said he doesnât expect a trade âwarâ, which will increase costs and lower profits for his company. But he also said if the war is on, his company will consider replacing products that they use which are from US brands with products from Thailand, Vietnam and even domestic brands. âWe understand our countryâs retaliatory measures and as Chinese we donât want our countryâs interests to be hurt by other countries,â he said. Besides fruits and pork, 33 items on the list were steel products, mainly stainless steel tubes. The China Iron and Steel Association (CISA) had urged the government to take tough measures to prevent the domestic market from being hurt by US-imported steel when the latter announced the Section-232 investigation. An employee with the CISA said a public announcement has yet to be made, while an employee with Taiyuan Iron and Steel (Group) Co., Ltd who preferred his name undisclosed said Chinaâs tariff measures on US products will inject confidence into domestic industries. According to statistics provided by marketing organization LangeSteel.com, in 2017, the US exported 83,600 tons of steel products to China, in which stainless steel tubes weighed 18,800 tons, 22.4 percent of the total volume. Xu Liying, an analyst with LangeSteel.com, said stainless steel tubes were chosen as the main item for tariff retaliation because they were the main type of US products exported to China, in terms of the volume and the value. In 2017, US steel products worth 567 million yuan were imported to China, and the value of stainless steel tubes was 115 million yuan, Xu said. She added that the total volume of stainless steel tubes exported to China from the US is not large. In 2017, Chinaâs import value of stainless steel tubes from the US accounted for only 10 percent of the countryâs total stainless steel tube imports. Therefore, Xu thinks the new tariff measures will not have big impact on domestic enterprises, suggesting them to use products from other countries in order to replace US products after the new measures are implemented. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council has decided to impose a tariff of 15 percent on 120 items of products imported from the US including fruits and related products, and a tariff of 25 percent on eight imported items, including pork and related products from the country, read a statement on the website of the Chinese Ministry of Finance. The statement said the tariffs, effective Monday, aim to offset losses incurred by US Section 232 measures. Despite worldwide objections, the US decided to impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum, with tariffs on imports from countries including China. China's decision also came after the US refused to respond to China's request for trade compensation negotiations with the US through the World Trade Organization (WTO) on March 26, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said on Monday in a statement on its official website. The decision shows China firmly opposes US unilateralism and protectionism, while maintaining rational behavior and restraint, Dong Yan, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of World Economics and Politics, told the Global Times on Monday. Exaggerating impact US President Donald Trump this week will unveil the list of Chinese imports targeted for additional US tariffs, Reuters reported on Monday. The targets are expected to be ""largely high-technology"" products, it noted, citing Trump administration officials. ""As Sino-US trade conflicts rise, bilateral trade between the two countries will see several rounds of retaliatory threats. But the threats, which are considered as bargaining chips, may not come true and descend into a trade war,"" Dong said. ""With much fanfare, the drama is now full-blown. It won't end so easily or be a brief one, otherwise, it would look bad on the Trump administration and the president himself,"" Tu Xinquan, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics, told the Global Times on Monday. The US has exaggerated the impact of technology transfer, according to Tu. ""The phenomenon may exist in some companies, but it's neither the Chinese government's policy nor promoted by laws,"" he said, noting the problem is easy to fix. Making China a future competitor, the US wants to beat China in the high-technology sector, ""but in a larger sense, the US hopes to lead with self-serving new rules even if they are not consistent with WTO rules,"" Dong said. Zhang Ming, chief economist at Ping An Securities, said in a note that aside from trade, the US is expected to limit Chinese foreign direct investment, talent flow and intellectual property protection. ""We need to prepare for the complexity of the game between the two sides,"" he said. Cooperation the right choice ""As a WTO member, China has the right to suspend tariff concessions on some US goods, and China hopes that the US would repeal all trade measures that go against WTO rules,"" the MOFCOM said. Cooperation is the only right choice for China and the US, and the two largest economies should discuss their concerns in negotiations, it added.

On the website of the U.S. National Pork Producers Council, a statement says that the Chinese retaliation on U.S. pork exports will harm the rural economy. A statement on the website of the U.S. National Pork Producers Council says that the Chinese retaliation on U.S. pork exports will harm the rural economy. [Screenshot: China Plus] In the statement, NPPC's president Jim Heimerl notes, ""We sell a lot of pork to China, so higher tariffs on our exports going there will harm our producers and undermine the rural economy. No one wins in these tit-for-tat trade disputes, least of all the farmers and the consumers."" The statement hit the NPPC website on March 23rd after China announced countermeasures in response to a previous U.S. move to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Starting April 2nd, China has formally suspended the tariff concessions on 128 products including pork and fruits, according to the Ministry of Finance. The Customs Tariff Commission of the Chinese State Council has decided to impose a tariff of 15 percent on 120 products imported from the United States including fruits and related products, and a tariff of 25 percent on eight items, including pork and related products, according to a statement posted on the ministry website. Exports remain important for U.S. pork producers. Of all the pork produced in the United States, 26% is sent abroad. The U.S. National Pork Producers Council says the U.S. produces slightly over 20 billion US dollarsâ worth of pork annually. 6.5 billion US dollars is exported overseas. Of that, 1.1 billion dollars is exported to China. Last year, China was the second largest U.S. pork export market by volume. The NPPC's mission is to advocate to the U.S. government about public policy interests of U.S. pork producers. The hog farmer's number one public policy concern is trade and exports. The NPPC says hog farmers and the pork producers in the United States are very concerned about a trade war with China, suggesting hog farmers want to export more pork to China, not less. What will the new pork tariffs mean for Chinese consumers? There are over 1.4 billion people in China, making up nearly 19% of the total global population. Pork is a staple in China, with pork consumption second only to rice in the country. China's Ministry of Agriculture estimates the annual consumption of pork per person in China is 59 kilograms, accounting for more than half of global consumption. By comparison, Americans consume around 23 kilograms of pork per year, according to data released in 2017 by Rabobank, a research firm specializing in food and agriculture. As such, Jim Monroe with the NPPC suggests itâs unlikely the United States would be able to make up the shortfall if pork exports to China dwindle amid the trade dispute. The NPPC is calling on the U.S. government to enter into talks with China, with the NPPC's Jim Monroe saying itâs up to all countries to trade fairly and follow international rules. He says trade disputes need to be resolved in a way that doesn't harm businesses, farmers or consumers. Despite worldwide objections, the Trump administration has decided to impose a 25-percent tariff on steel imports and a 10-percent tariff on aluminum from China. China could also be hit with other investment restrictions in the United States as the dispute moves forward. The Chinese Commerce Ministry contends the U.S. measures, which went into effect on March 23, which has severely undermined China's interests, according to a statement. The statement goes on to say that China advocates and supports a multilateral trade system, saying its move to suspend tariff concession on U.S. imports is a justifiable action to safeguard China's interests through WTO rules. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The measures abuse the security exception clause of World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and go against the principle of non-discrimination in multilateral trade, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOC) said in an online statement. Despite strong warnings from business groups and trade experts, President Donald Trump last month signed a memorandum that could impose tariffs on up to 60 billion U.S. dollars of imports from China and restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States. The move came after the U.S. administration took an increasingly hawkish turn on China, as it blamed its trade deficit with major trading partners for its domestic economic woes and job losses. It decided to impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum, with China as the major target. ""China's interests have been seriously damaged,"" the MOC said. To balance losses caused by the U.S move, the ministry proposed countermeasures on U.S. products worth about 3 billion U.S. dollars on March 23 and solicited public opinion. Based on domestic support, the policy has been put into effect. The Ministry of Finance on Monday announced a 15-percent tariff on 120 items from the United States including fruit, and a 25-percent tariff on eight items including pork. China had worked out measures to boost imports and widen market access to mitigate tension with the United States, but to no avail, analysts said. The two sides have failed to reach a consensus as the United States declined to respond to China's requests through the WTO for consultation, the MOC said. ""As a WTO member, China has the right not to meet some former obligations to the United States."" WRONG BATTLE The United States' goods trade deficit with China is considered the main reason for President Trump's stance, but the figure is inflated and does not show the full picture of China-U.S. economic ties. Trump exaggerates the deficit, Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at the Yale University Jackson Institute for Global Affairs, said at a Beijing-based think tank event. A hefty part of the deficit comes from the supply chain effect, which means components are just assembled in China but originally produced elsewhere, Roach said and estimated the figure could be cut significantly if adjusted accordingly. ""Politicians have no patience for statistics -- they find it much easier to point the finger at China,"" Roach said. The United States has a huge service trade surplus with China, and the gap has been widening. China's service trade deficit totaled 255 billion U.S. dollars last year, with the United States as a major contributor. From 2006 to 2016, the deficit with the United States increased more than 30-fold. Given the situation, the decision to raise tariffs is improper and dangerous, and likely to cause losses for the country and its trade partners. ""I am quite worried about the potential for escalating trade conflict between the United States and China,"" Roach said. ""Maybe Trump is bluffing... but we can not afford to ignore the risks. The stakes are too high for all of us."" COOPERATION; ONLY COOPERATION Despite the friction, China is still interested in economic cooperation for mutual benefit. ""Cooperation is the only valid option for China and the United States,"" the MOC said, calling for dialogue and consultation to avoid more harm to the broader picture of China-U.S. cooperation. For decades, China-U.S. economic ties have expanded steadily and generated huge benefits for people on both sides. Trade friction may be unavoidable but what matters is bridging differences through reasonable talks and exploring new fronts for cooperation, said Long Guoqiang, deputy director of the State Council development research center. Economists believe that the tariffs plan will backfire in any case. ""U.S. consumers will bear the costs of the Trump administration's tariffs,"" said Justin Yifu Lin, dean of the Institute for New Structural Economics of Peking University. As U.S. consumer demand for daily necessities will not change simply by raising the costs of imported products, the United States will either continue to import from China or it will import from Vietnam, India and other countries where prices are already higher. The result will be the same: U.S. consumers will pay more for the same products, Lin said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The memorandum is based on the so-called Section 301 investigation into alleged Chinese intellectual property and technology transfer practices, launched by the Trump administration in August 2017. What the US did, in disregard of China's strengthened protection for intellectual property rights, the WTO rules and the calls from the business communities, is a typical act of unilateralism and trade protectionism. The whole world is now saying no to this unreasonable decision as it damages the stability of China-US economic and trade ties, undermines global trade order, and jeopardizes the recovery of world economy. A backfire is what the US side deserves for its reckless move. Under no circumstances will China sit idly and allow its legitimate rights and interests to be undermined. Chinaâs Ministry of Commerce announced on Friday that it is considering higher tariffs for imported US products worth about $3 billion to balance losses caused by the US tariffs on steel and aluminum. According to the announcement, the measures, or the suspension of tariff concessions, will target 128 US products, including pork, wine, and seamless steel tubes. China does not hope to have a trade war with anyone, but is never afraid of it. China is fully prepared to firmly defend its legitimate interests, and also has the confidence and capability to cope with any challenge. It must be figured out that the US side has to take all the consequences if the economic and trade ties between the two countries finally trapped in danger because of its own wilful actions. As a major propeller of and contributor to an open global economy, as well as a guarder of free trade, China, even when dealing with the deliberate provocation from the US, has made a lot of efforts, showed great sincerity and put forward reasonable suggestions based on a principle of mutual respect and win-win cooperation. However, Washington inclines to hasty and arbitrary choice, which will definitely result in Chinaâs follow-up backfire to safeguard its legitimate interests. There is, indeed, a political force in US who completely turned a blind eye to the interests of US businesses and consumers, insisted that it can be âa piece of cake for their country to win the trade warâ. Such argument was strongly resisted by the academia, business, social organizations and the public of the US, who believe that the administrationâs unilateral move is not helpful in settling the problems of China-US trade, but hurts the US itself, since the US consumers and retailers will ultimately pay the bill for the chain reaction triggered by the tariff plan. A trade war will not only drag down the USâ employment and disrupt its manufacturing sector, but also add uncertainties to the market and cost the livelihoods of US exporters. In recent days, the USâ rash but complacent move has drawn mounting blames from the whole world. Finance ministers and central bank governors of the G20, in their recent-concluded ministerial meeting, voiced concerns that the USâ latest decision may incite a global trade war, and as a result hinder economic growth of the whole globe. âTaken together, Mr. Trumpâs actions demonstrate his resolve to turn away from a decades-long move toward open markets and integrated world economies and toward a more starkly protectionist approach that erects barriers around a Fortress America,â the New York Times commented in a recent article. The financial market voted no confidence to the wrong policies and moves of the US side as the US stock indexes have fallen following the signing of the memorandum. It is predicable that the USâ latest move at the cost of shared interests of all countries will pose a series of threats to global trade order and world economy. On one hand, the USâ irresponsible actions have shaken the market expectations and confidence, which can be evidenced by the sell-off in stock markets of Australian and Asian countries. On the other hand, its deviation from multilateralism will pose a threat to global economic governance. Taking both China-US economic and trade ties as well as global landscape into consideration, the trade protectionism advocated by the US brings nothing but harm, and will never been accepted by the world. Those who lift a rock to attack others will only have their own toes squashed at last. China urges the US to pull back the decision before it is too late and make a prudent and cautious decision, so as to avoid dragging bilateral economic and trade ties, global trade and world economy into crisis. The US should never underestimate Chinaâs resolution and capability to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

However, underneath the moment of unity between the United States and its European allies, there are longstanding discord and distrust between the two sides of the Atlantic on strategies, interests and policies. A RARE SHOW OF UNITY The United States announced Monday that it would expel 60 Russian diplomats and close the Russian Consulate in Seattle to retaliate for the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian intelligence officer, and his daughter in London earlier in March. On March 15, the United States, Britain, France and Germany issued a joint statement condemning Russia over the incident, which was followed by the European Union (EU). The EU said last week it was recalling its ambassador to Russia. At least 24 nations, including the United States and 17 EU members, have pledged to expel Russian diplomats. On Tuesday NATO joined the alliance, declaring it would withdraw the accreditation of seven staff members at the Russian Mission to NATO and to deny pending accreditation requests for three other Russian diplomats following the ""attack in Salisbury"" against Skripal and his daughter. ""Those consultations have resulted so far in the expulsion of over 140 Russian officials by over 25 NATO Allies and partners,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. ""This is a broad, strong and coordinated international response. And as part of that response, NATO is unified in taking further steps,"" the statement added. Despite NATO's support of Britain and its urge for Russia to address Britain's questions on March 14 and 15, Stoltenberg said that the alliance remained committed to a dual-track approach of strong defense and openness to dialogue, including by working to prepare the next meeting of the NATO-Russia Council. Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia were found unconscious on a bench at a shopping center in Salisbury earlier this month. They remain in critical condition after exposure to a nerve agent, which, according to the British authorities, could have originated from Russia. Moscow has denied any involvement in the incident. After European Council President Donald Tusk's announcement that a total of 14 EU countries would be teaming up with fellow member Britain in ordering out Russian diplomats, British Prime Minister Theresa May praised the ""great solidarity"" with Britain shown by the EU, North America, NATO and beyond. She also warned that the West needs to develop a long-term response to the ""renewed Russian threat."" DISCORD UNDERNEATH In spite of the seemingly unified confrontational stance on Russia, there have been voices within these countries calling for dialogue. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said ""we remain open to constructive dialogue with Russia, which remains necessary on many international issues."" Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said on Monday that resources should be now focused on mending the widening rift between the East and the West. Meanwhile, Finnish Prime Minister Juha Sipila told a separate press conference on the same day that the decision to expel a Russian diplomat was not easy for the country. The coordinated actions were not merely a response to the poisoning attack, U.S. officials said. ""It's also part of a broader set of actions that the Russians have taken for quite some time internationally: a steady drumbeat of destabilizing any aggressive actions."" Dan Mahaffee, senior vice president and director of policy at the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress, a U.S. think tank, told Xinhua that the number of Russian agents has been viewed with growing concern in the United States and allied countries. The U.S. moves ""are far more than symbolic as they are an attempt to hinder Russian intelligence gathering in these countries,"" he said. Moscow has denied the accusation, calling the deportation of its diplomats ""a provocative gesture."" The Trump administration has been under pressure from inside the country and the West. The mid-term elections urge it to ""play tough"" against Moscow, and Western allies have been disheartened by its reluctance to attack Moscow directly over the poisoning attack, as required by the NATO treaties, observers said. The White House's ambiguity in dealing with Russia has also sparked rage and dissatisfaction inside the United States, where doubts of Trump' s ""collusion"" with Russia in the 2016 elections still linger. Mahaffee said that it will continue to be a challenge for Trump to deal with Russia. END OF TRANSATLANTICISM? Since Trump took office, his ""America First"" policy has frequently collided with those of his European partners. He called NATO ""obsolete,"" opposed the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, withdrew from the Paris Agreement on climate change, threatened to scrap the Iranian nuclear deal and announced moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. There has been increasing dissatisfaction in Europe towards the United States, with European mainstream media holding the view that even staunch Atlanticists can no longer deny the crisis in transatlantic relations and blaming Washington for posing threats to the common values shared across the Atlantic. In the wake of Trump's announcement to impose a 25-percent tariff on steel imports and a 10-percent one on aluminum imports amid global opposition, the European Union (EU) planned ""a whole arsenal"" of countermeasures. Europe ""wants to avoid escalation"" but ""must keep the multilateral framework"" because ""protectionism is never the answer: protectionism is nationalism, nationalism is war and the war only makes losers,"" European Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici told a French television news channel earlier this month. Trump has torn the mask off the U.S. face and shown the true face of an unscrupulous and self-reliant world power, German politician Rolf Mutzenich wrote in his article entitled ""End of Transatlanticism?"" The apparent solidarity between the United States and its European allies in expelling Russian diplomats could not cover up their differences on strategies, interests and policies which has been tearing the two sides apart. The poisoning incident is just a small issue Washington is taking advantage of to show solidarity with its allies amid the escalating rift, analysts said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

However, whatâs behind the trade war? How will China respond? Here are eight facts that both Chinese and Americans should know. 1. The trade war was started by the US. US President Donald Trump signed a memorandum that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of imports from China and restrictions on Chinese investment in the US on Mar. 22. The trade war has erupted as a result of the violations of international rules on the behalf of the Trump administration, and it was forced upon China. There might be multiple reasons behind the trade war, but one thing is clear that China has no other option. Compromising will never bring peace. 2. China has confidence and is fully prepared. Through the responses by Chinaâs Foreign Ministry, embassies, and Ministry of Commerce, it is easy to see that the country is well prepared for the trade war diplomatically and economically, even politically and militarily. The Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said during a regular press conference on March 23, 2018 that China will fight to the end. It is not at all talk, it is supported by Chinaâs true capability. The Ministry of Commerce announced on the same day that it was considering higher tariffs for imported US products worth about $3 billion, and the country is currently planning to increase tariffs on a wider range of imports from the US including aircrafts and computer chips. 3. Whatâs behind the trade war is a fear the US has regarding the rise of China. The intention of the US is clear: to contain the rising of China, which conforms to its mentality as an established power. Chinaâs nonmilitary approach to handle relations with major countries is a rational choice, and also an unavoidable process for a developing country. China should brace itself for this process. 4. To urge its allies to escalate pressure on China is merely a case of wishful thinking on the US side. In order to seek for help from its allies, Trump on March 22 granted tariff exemptions on steel and aluminum to Australia, Canada, the European Union (EU), and South Korea until May 1, 2018 as discussions continue. However, German newspaper Die Welt warned that if the EU compromises this time, Trump might become more irrational and even aim at the EU in the future. Most countries in the world lack strategic confidence in the US, yet at the same time they are maintaining good trade relations with China. They will never be puppets of the US for the maximization of their national interests. 5. The trade war is not only unfairly aimed at China, it also violates global trade rules. On Mar. 8, Trump signed a tariff order to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum but offered relief to some U.S. allies including Mexico and Canada. This action is a violation of the international trade rules, which will bring damages to its own image and reputation. 6. The trade war will only hurt others without necessarily benefiting the US itself. According to US media, the trade war will increase the living cost of US consumers and cause negative impacts on major enterprises. The countermeasures to be taken by China will further worsen the situation, especially in the fields of manufacturing, employment, and imports and exports. Australian scholars predict that the GDP of the US will drop by 5.2 percent if countermeasures are taken by every country, leading to a loss of $933.2 billion. 7. Starting the trade war, the US goes against the whole world. If Trump insists on starting the trade war, the whole international society will suffer a loss from it. Research by the Brookings Institution indicated that if the US increases tariffs by 10 percent, the GDP of most economies will drop between 1 and 4.5 percent. The research further pointed out that a 40-percent increase in the tariffs would trigger a global economic crisis. 8. The victory belongs to China. China will take targeted measures to counter the unilateral move of the US and safeguard its interests through legal approaches. Large trade war will hurt both the Chinese and the US economies, but it also spurs China to transform its economy in a better direction. China has nothing to be afraid of. As long as the Chinese are united, the victory will belong to China. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

As China threatened to slap retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports in response to Trump's announcement Thursday, the most worrying group is Washington state's apple farmers, Washington-based KUOW Radio said. China has been one of Washington's biggest customers among 60 countries around the world that import a third of the crops grown in the state, it said. According to statistics by the Washington Apple Commission, China was the sixth largest international apple market for the state between 2013-2016. Todd Fryhover, the commission's president, told the radio that Washington apple growers fret about the prospect of China imposing tariffs in response to U.S. unilateral trade pressure. ""Free trade is something that we all push and look forward to. But we're gonna be cautious and wait ... and see what happens,"" he said. According to data released in 2015 by the Economic and Commercial Section of the Chinese Consulate General in San Francisco, Washington is the top state in the United States in terms of the output of apples, cherries, concord grapes and other crops. China is the largest foreign destination market of Washington state's farm products, the data shows. Washington, which is among the most trade dependent states in the United States, counts China as its largest trading partner for both imports and exports. Last year, the state exported more than 18 billion dollars in goods to China, with airplanes and wheat among the top exports, according to U.S. trade data released by the U.S. Census Bureau. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Speaking here at the WTO goods council meeting, Zhang Xiangchen, the Chinese ambassador to the WTO, said that what the United States had done contradicts its commitments made at the WTO more than a decade ago. Zhang noted in his speech that the United States had ""explicitly, officially, repeatedly and unconditionally confirmed"" that it would base a ""Section 301"" decision only on adopted DSB findings. ""Section 301"" is a measure under the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 that allows the president to take all appropriate action, including retaliation, if an investigation finds foreign trade practices burden or restrict U.S. commerce or are unreasonable or discriminatory. ""According to the WTO rulings and the U.S. commitment, the U.S. shall by no means determine unilaterally based on a 301 investigation that other members have violated the WTO rules,"" Zhang said during a meeting of WTO's Council on Trade in Goods. Last Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum that could impose tariffs on up to 60 billion U.S. dollars of imports from China and restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States. The memorandum is based on a Section 301 investigation, launched by the Trump administration in August 2017, into alleged Chinese intellectual property and technology transfer practices. Accusing the United States of ""setting a very bad precedent by bluntly breaching its commitment made to the world"", Zhang called on WTO members to ""jointly prevent the resurrection of 301 investigations and lock this beast back into the cage of the WTO rules"". He also reiterated that China is fully prepared to react to the conclusions and measures of Section 301 by the U.S., and would firmly take the WTO rules and other necessary ways to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The US, as the largest economy in todayâs global economic integration, will inevitably hurt its own interests through its irrational and unilateral practices, said the professor, adding that such approach will also hurt others without necessarily benefiting itself. US President Donald Trump recently signed a memorandum, deciding to impose tariffs on imports from China. It has aroused huge attention from the international community. Many international experts noted that the unilateral move goes against the global trade rules, which will pose a threat to the US, China and even the world. They believe that the US will lose not only the trade war, but also its reputation. As a major country, the US should stay rational and manage differences with China through cooperation, they suggested. âThe decision of the Trump administration to largely impose tariffs on Chinese imports is just the tip of an iceberg of its trade protectionism,â said Daniel Gros, director of the Centre for European Policy Studies. The US used to be an initiator of multilateral trade, but it now is marching against in the opposite direction, the director added. According to him, the Chinese and the US economies are highly interdependent after 20 years of development, and both of the two will get hurt if one of them starts a trade war. Henning VÃ¶pel, director of Hamburg Institute of International Economics told Peopleâs Daily that the punitive tariff measures of the US are not only aimed at China. They could be shifted toward the European Union (EU) at any time, so the EU will not stand aside, VÃ¶pel noted. He pointed out that the trade war might trigger a monetary war, which would bring the most disastrous situation since the global economic crisis in 2008. Expert Josef Braml from German Council on Foreign Relations explained that the US, driven by trade protectionism, believes global trade is a war to the knife. In addition, the US has avoided the WTO rules and managed to prove the rationality of its policies, which threatens the authority of the WTO. He suggested that the world take actions against the punitive tariff policies of the US, otherwise every exporting country will become a loser in the trade war. The US, violating trade rules, is pressuring its partner by protectionism, Robel said, adding that it has greatly damaged the global trading system. The practice of the Trump administration will inescapably cause negative impacts on the countryâs reputation, one of its core competitiveness, he noted. Trump once declared that trade wars are good, and they are easy to win. But indeed, the reality is just the opposite, said Paul Krugman, a New York Times Op-Ed columnist. China's trade surpluses, in other words, are largely a statistical illusion. In fact, many of the Chinese imports are just products fabricated from parts made in other countries, especially South Korea and Japan, said Krugman. IPhones are a good example to prove the columnistâs point. These phones are made in China, but China only accounts for less than 4 percent of their price, Krugman explained. Therefore, nearly half of the USâs trade deficits may come from those countries exporting parts to China. Former US Ambassador to China Max Baucus told Peopleâs Daily that the Trump administration is promoting more antagonistic policies toward China, which will increase the tension between the two countries. However, both the peoples of China and the US hope to maintain a sound relationship with each other, because economic cooperation with China is important for the US. Therefore, the trade war is not in line with the interests of the two countries. âThe next phase is critical, and I hope the two countries could stay calm and focus on important matters: employment and livelihood,â said Baucus, expressing concerns toward the emerging trade war. He stressed that the tariffs are both wrong and dangerous, and such approach will not help solve the trade issues between China and the US. The two countries should stay clear and seek solutions through cooperation, he suggested. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Despite risks of harming interests of China and the United States itself, Trump on Thursday signed the executive memorandum that could result in heavy tariffs on up to 60 billion U.S. dollars of imports from China as well as harsher restrictions on Chinese investments. Meanwhile, Trump also announced a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum earlier this month, triggering global criticism on his trade bullying move. The trade protectionist policies adopted by Washington have severely violated basic trade rules built by the international community in the past several decades, and were also ruining the international image and status of the world's biggest economy. China and the United States are each other's key trade partners. After decades of cooperation, they are no longer able to draw a clear line between their interests. Despite competition, the two economies are remarkably complementary to each other and their relationship has been seen as a story of mutual benefit. China has always advocated win-win cooperation and negotiated settlement of disputes. However, it will never remain silent when its rights and interests are damaged by other countries. China has prepared and has the strength to safeguard national interests, but it also hopes that both sides could remain rational and work together to preserve the broad picture of China-U.S. economic and trade relations. In recent years, China has promoted the development of its economic strength and technological advantages to a new level. With an optimized industrial structure, an enhanced economic resilience and a broader space for macroeconomic policies, China is not afraid of engaging in a trade war. With a huge domestic market and a complete system of industry, China is capable of taking counter measures against hostilities. Even so, China still underlines that it prefers to settle disputes through dialogue and consultation. As the two largest economies in the world, China and the United States will never benefit from a trade war that may devastate global economic stability. It is hardly avoidable for any two countries to have conflict of interests in doing business, compliance with trade rules and launching dialogue and exchange of opinions will be the only right way to solve disputes in trade. Washington should take Beijing's stance seriously and do not be penny wise and pound foolish, which will hurt itself and others as well.

[Photo/VCG] Despite of strong warnings from all sides, US President Donald Trump incited a trade war by signing a memorandum that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of imports from China and restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States on Thursday. The memorandum is based on the so-called Section 301 investigation into alleged Chinese intellectual property and technology transfer practices, launched by the Trump administration in August 2017. What the US did, in disregard of China's strengthened protection for intellectual property rights, the WTO rules and the calls from the business communities, is a typical act of unilateralism and trade protectionism. The whole world is now saying no to this unreasonable decision as it damages the stability of China-US economic and trade ties, undermines global trade order, and jeopardizes the recovery of world economy. A backfire is what the US side deserves for its reckless move. Under no circumstances will China sit idly and allow its legitimate rights and interests to be undermined. Chinaâs Ministry of Commerce announced on Friday that it is considering higher tariffs for imported US products worth about $3 billion to balance losses caused by the US tariffs on steel and aluminum. According to the announcement, the measures, or the suspension of tariff concessions, will target 128 US products, including pork, wine, and seamless steel tubes. China does not hope to have a trade war with anyone, but is never afraid of it. China is fully prepared to firmly defend its legitimate interests, and also has the confidence and capability to cope with any challenge. It must be figured out that the US side has to take all the consequences if the economic and trade ties between the two countries finally trapped in danger because of its own wilful actions. As a major propeller of and contributor to an open global economy, as well as a guarder of free trade, China, even when dealing with the deliberate provocation from the US, has made a lot of efforts, showed great sincerity and put forward reasonable suggestions based on a principle of mutual respect and win-win cooperation. However, Washington inclines to hasty and arbitrary choice, which will definitely result in Chinaâs follow-up backfire to safeguard its legitimate interests. There is, indeed, a political force in US who completely turned a blind eye to the interests of US businesses and consumers, insisted that it can be âa piece of cake for their country to win the trade warâ. Such argument was strongly resisted by the academia, business, social organizations and the public of the US, who believe that the administrationâs unilateral move is not helpful in settling the problems of China-US trade, but hurts the US itself, since the US consumers and retailers will ultimately pay the bill for the chain reaction triggered by the tariff plan. A trade war will not only drag down the USâ employment and disrupt its manufacturing sector, but also add uncertainties to the market and cost the livelihoods of US exporters. In recent days, the USâ rash but complacent move has drawn mounting blames from the whole world. Finance ministers and central bank governors of the G20, in their recent-concluded ministerial meeting, voiced concerns that the USâ latest decision may incite a global trade war, and as a result hinder economic growth of the whole globe. âTaken together, Mr. Trumpâs actions demonstrate his resolve to turn away from a decades-long move toward open markets and integrated world economies and toward a more starkly protectionist approach that erects barriers around a Fortress America,â the New York Times commented in a recent article. The financial market voted no confidence to the wrong policies and moves of the US side as the US stock indexes have fallen following the signing of the memorandum. It is predicable that the USâ latest move at the cost of shared interests of all countries will pose a series of threats to global trade order and world economy. On one hand, the USâ irresponsible actions have shaken the market expectations and confidence, which can be evidenced by the sell-off in stock markets of Australian and Asian countries. On the other hand, its deviation from multilateralism will pose a threat to global economic governance. Taking both China-US economic and trade ties as well as global landscape into consideration, the trade protectionism advocated by the US brings nothing but harm, and will never been accepted by the world. Those who lift a rock to attack others will only have their own toes squashed at last. China urges the US to pull back the decision before it is too late and make a prudent and cautious decision, so as to avoid dragging bilateral economic and trade ties, global trade and world economy into crisis. The US should never underestimate Chinaâs resolution and capability to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump signed a memorandum that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion worth of imports from China and propose restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States. It is the latest unilateral move by the US that would pose a threat to global trade. The memorandum is based on a so-called Section 301 investigation into alleged Chinese intellectual property and technology transfer practices, launched by the Trump administration in August 2017. The tariffs will target 100 imported Chinese goods in as many as 100 categories, hitting everything from shoes and clothing to consumer electronics. âWe want no trade war with anyone, but if our hands are forced, we will not quail nor recoil from it,â said Hua Chunying, spokesperson of Chinaâs Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on Wednesday. According to Bai, China made important initial progress in carrying out the 100-day action plan with the US during 2017, and companies from both countries signed deals worth more than $250 billion dollars during Trump's state visit to China. These are practical and sincere actions taken by China, he added. âIf the US is not seeing our good intentions and on the other hand making further provocations, we will definitely fight back, with necessary countermeasures,â Bai noted. The tariffs are placed under the banner of Chinaâs âunfair practicesâ, but what lies under the tariffs is a protectionist approach, the deputy director explained. Associate researcher Su Qingyi of the Institute of World Economy and Politics under Chinese Academy of Social Sciences told ThePaper.cn that the tariff will definitely bring about negative impacts on Chinese export industry. But it will not be able to narrow the trade balance between China and the US in a way that will be detrimental to China, Su added, saying that in such a case more Chinese enterprises may choose to shift their markets to other countries. Experts analyzed that China would probably take counteractions by imposing high tariffs on the US products that are exported in high volumes to China, for example, soybeans, automobiles and planes. The range is smaller than that of the US, but it centers on agriculture, an industry that has a big influence on the US politics, said Alec Philips, chief US political economist for Goldman Sachs Research. The US has the demand for Chinese imports, but it doesnât manufacture these products, said Cao Dewang, founder and head of the world's top auto glass manufacturer Fuyao Glass, adding that it is the source of the trade balance between the two countries. He believes that the increase in tariffs is not a solution as long as thereâs demand in the US. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Despite warnings from business groups and trade experts, Trump on Thursday signed a presidential memorandum that could impose tariffs of up to 60 billion U.S. dollars on imports from China, the latest unilateral move that poses a threat to global trade. Trump has directed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to publish a list of proposed Chinese goods that could be subject to tariffs in 15 days. The U.S. Treasury Department will have 60 days to propose restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States, according to the presidential memorandum. The tariffs ""could be about 60 billion"" dollars, Trump said Thursday at the White House before signing the memorandum. But a senior White House official told reporters earlier in the day that the number would be close to 50 billion dollars. Wallace Cheng, country director for China with Geneva-based think tank International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development (ICTSD), said that the proposed high tariffs targeting Chinese imports are a case of Washington ""shooting itself in the foot."" ""China has plenty of countermeasures with which it could choose to retaliate, for example, cutting orders of Boeing, banning imports of beans and beef, etc,"" Cheng said. Guoyong Liang, an economic officer at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), said that he believes the way to resolve the trade imbalance between China and the United States should be expanding China's imports, rather than to limit China's exports to the United States. ""To this end, the two parties need to conduct effective negotiations and make necessary compromises,"" he said. ""Resorting to a trade war will lead to a loss on both sides, and have negative impacts on both economies as well as the global trade system,"" he added. Noting that the existing multilateral system ""provides effective trade remedy measures and dispute settlement mechanisms"", he said that members of the World Trade Organization should resolve their disputes within the multilateral framework. The proposed tariff against China came at the end of the USTR's eight-month probe of alleged intellectual property rights violations by China. The probe was launched under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which is widely seen as outdated. Liang said that recourse to domestic laws and unilateral measures will threaten the authority and effectiveness of the multilateral trading system, and in the long run harms the stability and growth of the world economy. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

(Xinhua Photo) Reade More : > China will fight back over U.S. tariffs: Ambassador > China readies as Trump's trade war plan spells failure The Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) announced Friday morning it will impose tariffs on US imports worth $3 billion in a bid to offset its loss incurred by the US' decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The products include seven categories and cover 128 types of products, according to a statement on the website of the MOFCOM. The ministry plans to impose 15 percent tariff on 120 types of products, like fruits, nuts, wine and seamless tubes, worth $977 million. A 25 percent tariff will be imposed on products that include pork and recycled aluminum products. A MOFCOM spokesperson was quoted as saying in the statement that the US is citing the excuse of national security by imposing 25 percent and 10 percent tariffs on its steel and aluminum product imports. In line with WTO rules, China decided on a list for suspension of concessions. If China and the US can't reach trade compensation agreements, China will impose tariffs on the first part of the list of products, the spokesperson noted, adding that tariffs will be imposed on the second part after evaluating the US' influence on China. China reserves its right to adjust the tariff measures in accordance with practical situations and will fulfill necessary produces in line with WTO rules, according to the spokesperson. MOFCOM also said it will take legal actions under the WTO framework, safeguarding the stability and authority of a multilateral trade system together with other WTO members. On Friday morning (Beijing time), US President Donald Trump announced the US will impose tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods over ""intellectual property theft."" The Chinese Embassy in the US said ""It is a typical unilateral trade protectionist action. China is strongly disappointed and firmly opposes such an action."" The US persisted in conducting the ""301 investigation"" and announced relevant trade measures. The US is ignoring rational voices and disregarding the mutually-beneficial nature of China-US trade relations, along with the consensus reached by the two countries of managing differences constructively through consultations, said a statement on its website Friday. ""But China is not afraid of and will not recoil from a trade war. China is confident and capable of facing any challenge. If a trade war were initiated by the US, China would fight to the end to defend its own legitimate interests with all necessary measures,"" said a statement released by the Chinese Embassy."
266,http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2018/0323/c90000-9440910.html,China readies as Trump's trade war plan spells failure,"March 23, 2018","US President Donald Trump signed an executive memo on Thursday, imposing up to $60 billion in tariffs against Chinese imports and investment restrictions on technology transfer and acquisitions by China. This is the biggest trade action that the Trump administration has instituted, with a massive scale that is rarely seen, even among the history of international trade conflicts. Though the news arrived at midnight in Beijing, the Chinese government is expected to respond quickly to defend the country's legitimate trade rights. Public opinions have indicated that China will begin by targeting soybeans and other agricultural products imported from the US as retaliation. China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Wednesday that the two countries should not start trade war. She said that if China is forced into this situation, it will neither be afraid nor avoid it. It is fair to say that they are not diplomatic language. Instead, they should be taken as the united voice of the Chinese people that they will not be bullied. The Trump administration has apparently misjudged this situation, due to its wrongful interpretation of a key few factors. First, the US government is wrongfully taking its own economic hardships out its trade relationship with China. Second, it is overestimating its ability to adjust international trade in the market economy's private sectors, as well as its advantage in a trade war with China. Finally, it has underestimated China's resolve regarding retaliatory measures, and it has not fully considered the price it will pay by starting this trade war. There is an old, but very applicable Chinese proverb that states that ""The self-conceited troops are destined to lose."" This trade war is akin to the Trump administration ""playing with fire"" and it will end in disaster for the US. Trump's attempts to impose tariffs and solve trade imbalance problems, while also reviving the American economy, is an incredibly short-sighted solution that the American people largely disagree with. In fact, the tariffs have been met with a major outcry from American citizens and businesses alike. To a certain extent, it appears that this trade war is desired and waged solely by President Trump and his team, while lacking the rest of the country's support. China is now being forced to fight back in this trade war. China's society is highly united, and this will be reflected in its actions as the trade war comes into effect. China's residents possess a level of endurance that the US cannot compete with. Any trade war will only lead to a lose-lose situation. While both China and the US are economically resilient, one will invariably fail and that will result in political backlash. The Chinese people and American public will blame President Trump for the turmoil both countries will have experienced. Additionally, the Trump administration, along with the GOP, will suffer in the US' future midterm and presidential elections. The trade war will be used as a major example of Trump's failures if he seeks reelection. China is a powerful nation and a force to be reckoned with, meaning that China will not abide deception and will not be taken advantage of. In other words, the US should not fool itself into thinking that China can be pressured to fold under such tactics. Another important aspect to keep in mind is that China's consumer market has surpassed that of the US and it is still expanding at a rapid pace. If a trade war were to take place, the two countries would be matched regarding the other's strengths and capabilities. Solving the trade deficit between the US and China is a complicated matter, requiring both sides to set aside its differences and work together. If the Trump administration is irrational enough to think a trade war will provide them some level of profitability, they are destined to fail. Many analysts have interpreted Thursday's memo as Trump's way of intimidating and sidelining China. This tariff is just a new way to flex his muscles at the world, but he has no more leverage over China than his predecessors have had. China is on a level playing field with the US in many respects, and its consumer market shows signs of even besting the US in some areas. Trump's famous temper tantrums indicates that his image is an act and that he is one of the most lackluster US presidents. Washington should dismiss the idea that China will concede in this trade war because it will find no white flags to mark China's surrender. Instead, Washington will charge blindly into a bullfighter's red cape. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

If somebody tries to impose a trade war upon us, we will fight. We will do whatever we can to defend the legitimate interests. We will also do whatever we can to safeguard the open global trading system,â said Cui in a video posted on the embassyâs Facebook account. Trump has directed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to publish a list of proposed Chinese goods that could be subject to tariffs in 15 days, while the U.S. Treasury Department will have 60 days to propose restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States, according to the presidential memorandum. The tariffs ""could be about 60 billion"" dollars, Trump said Thursday at the White House before signing the memorandum. But a senior White House official told reporters earlier in the day that the number would be close to 50 billion dollars. In the video post in response to the announcement, Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai sent a strong warning to âthose people who intend to fight a trade war.â âWe will certainly fight back. We will retaliate. If people want to play tough, we will play tough with them, and see who will last longer,â he said. He also warned that a unilateral approach, protectionist approach or a trade war will not help anybody and will hurt American people and businesses because it makes no economic or political sense. âSo the end of it will be hurting everybody. It will certainly affect the daily lives of the American middle class people. It will affect the balance sheet of American companies. It will affect the indexes of the financial market. It will undermine peopleâs confidence in the long-term economic prospects. I donât think anybody can gain anything from it,â the ambassador said. Trumpâs memorandum is based on a so-called Section 301 investigation into alleged Chinese intellectual property and technology transfer practices, launched by the Trump administration in August 2017. Section 301, once heavily used in the 1980s and the early 1990s, allows the U.S. president to unilaterally impose tariffs or other trade restrictions on foreign countries. But the United States has rarely used the outdated trade tool since the World Trade Organization (WTO) came into being in 1995. ""It became no longer necessary really for the United States that they have to use that law, because now we have an effective dispute settlement system under the WTO,"" said Chad Bown, a trade expert and senior fellow at the Washington D.C.-based Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE). The memorandum follows Trump's recent tariff plan on steel and aluminum imports and January's tariffs levied on imported solar panels and washing machines. These unilateral moves have prompted strong opposition and warnings from business groups around the world. In a letter to Trump on Sunday, 45 U.S. trade associations, representing retail, technology, agriculture and other consumer-product industries, urged the administration not to move forward its tariff plan on Chinese imports, as it would hurt U.S. consumers and companies. A group of 25 major U.S. retail companies, including Walmart, Costco and Best Buy, also warned on Monday that any additional broad-based tariff would worsen U.S. inequity and ""punish American working families"" with higher prices on household basics like clothing, shoes and electronics. If the Trump administration imposes a 25-percent tariff on information and communications technology imports from China, it would cost the U.S. economy 332 billion dollars over the next 10 years, according to a report recently released by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a U.S. technology policy think tank. ""Simply put, tariffs are damaging taxes on American consumers,"" said Thomas J. Donohue, President and CEO of U.S. Chamber of Commerce, warning the Trump administration's tariff plan could lead to ""a destructive trade war"" with serious consequences for U.S. economic growth and job creation. ""Tariffs of $30 billion a year would wipe out over a third of the savings American families received from the doubling of the standard deduction in tax reform. If the tariffs reach $60 billion, which has been rumored, the impact would be even more devastating,"" Donohue said."

[Photo: Xinhua] The signed legal instruments was handed over to Chairperson of AU Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat after the signing. The agreement will be submitted for ratification by state parties of the agreement in accordance with their domestic laws. The decision to form the AfCFTA was adopted in January 2012 during the 18th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the AU while AfCFTA negotiations were launched by the AU in 2015. The AfCFTA is aimed at creating a single continental market for goods and services with free movement of businesses and investments. This, according to the AU, will pave the way for accelerating the establishment of the Continental Customs Union and the African Customs Union. The AfCFTA will make Africa the largest free trade area created in terms of the number of participating countries since the formation of the World Trade Organization, according to the AU. The AfCFTA could create an African market of over 1.2 billion people with a GDP of 2.5 trillion U.S. dollars, the pan-African bloc said. The AfCFTA will progressively eliminate tariffs on intra-African trade, making it easier for African businesses to trade within the continent and cater to and benefit from the growing African market, said the AU. The UN Economic Commission for Africa estimates that the AfCFTA has the potential both to boost intra-African trade by 53.2 percent by eliminating import duties, and to double this trade if non-tariff barriers are also reduced. Together with the signing of the agreement on the AfCFTA, 27 African countries also signed the Protocol to the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community on Wednesday relating to free movement of persons, right of residence and right of establishment. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The latest steel and aluminum tariffs White House announced Thursday came at an important moment for China â the Two Sessions. As a result, this controversial move has stirred up controversy among Chinaâs lawmakers and the public. On politically sensitive issues like trade, too much public attention is not necessarily a good thing. In remarks before signing the proclamations, President Trump tried to make it clear that the move is not only economic, but also political. Such rhetoric is useless as no one would fail to understand the real intention of the move. Moreover, economists have long argued that trade is not the real cause of cutting jobs in American metal industries. However, the White House has seemingly failed to note that China happens to have its own domestic politics. Hours after President Trumpâs tariff announcement, China Iron and Steel Association issued a statement asking the Chinese government to take measures against US steel products. On Chinaâs more outspoken social media platforms, resentment could be seen rising rapidly. So far, reaction of the Chinese government has been more muted. In his two sessions press meet a few hours before White House finalized the tariff move, Chinaâs Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that in a globalized world, trade war is particularly unhelpful, as it will harm the initiator as well as the target country. China hopes the two sides will have a calm and constructive dialogue as equals, and find a win-win solution. This moderate response does not mean the US move will not affect politics inside China. For one thing, over the past few years, China has been striving to deal with the overcapacity in the steel industry. A report published in July 2016 predicted that about 1.8 million jobs would be lost in the steel and coal industries as a result of capacity reduction. Traditionally a strong base for steel production, Hebei Province is at the front line of the change. In Hebei, survey showed that more than 40 percent of workers whose lives would be affected by the new policy had been working in the same plant for more than 10 years. In other words, Chinaâs effort to reshape its steel industry comes at a political and social cost. In a statement justifying the steel and aluminum tariffs, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross wrote that since 1998, more than 75,000 steel jobs have disappeared in America. If this amounts to justification for a trade war, one doesnât really need to compare the numbers to imagine what kind of measures those laid-off workers in China will want their government to take. For bilateral relations, underestimating the spillover from domestic politics can be destabilizing. For China-US ties, it is more so, given the long existing mutual distrust. For the moment, it has been widely reported that China is confused about the Trump administrationâs trade objectives. To some extent, this is true as the White House thinks more about domestic politics when it chooses a trade stance. One should also note that the White House can only think prudently before the real trade war breaks out. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

(Photo by Cai Minjie from China News Service) China will expand its market access by lowering tariffs on imported vehicles and some consumer goods, the Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan told a press conference at the ongoing annual sessions of Chinaâs national legislature and top political advisory body. China is home to the worldâs second largest consumer market, and consumption has ,for the fourth consecutive year, become the largest driver of economic growth, Zhong said. About 400 million of its 1.4 billion population are middle-income earners, the minister noted, adding that continuous social and economic development, rising incomes of the residents and improving livelihoods mean there is huge consumption potential in China. As a result of Chinaâs economic progress and supporting policy in recent years, China maintained a rapid growth in its vehicle sales, with the number topping the world since 2009. At the same time, car ownership kept rising. In 2016, over 20 million new vehicles were sold. The volum of imported vehicles has been growing as well. In the first 11 months of 2017, a total of 1.1 million cars were imported, and the number for the whole year is estimated at 1.2 million, according to the import and export commission of the China Automobile Dealers Association. Analysts regard the lower tariff on imported cars as good news for Chinese market, as it will offer wider choices for consumers by stimulating domestic manufacturers to upgrade the industry. The latest tax reduction on imported cars to 25 percent was announced on July 1, 2006. Industry insiders believe the tax reduction will not have a big impact on domestic market in the short term, because most of the best-selling foreign models are already produced in China. In future, the imported luxury cars will benefit most from the policy, according to the Beijing Business Today."

A more open China will play a more important role on the world stage. Forty years ago, late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping opened the curtains on China's reform and opening up drive. Huge changes have taken place since then. The country is now in a race to further deepen reforms with its doors expected to open even wider to the world. WIDE OPEN MARKET, LOWER TARIFF China's economy has grown rapidly since then, becoming the world's second largest and an engine of world economy, and contributing more than 30 percent of global growth. This year, the government set its GDP growth target at around 6.5 percent. To achieve this goal, a wide open Chinese market is expected, allowing China to attract more foreign investors as well as to better integrate with the international market. China will open its doors wider to foreign investors and further liberalize and facilitate trade and investment, said Premier Li Keqiang, when delivering a government work report at the ongoing first session of the 13th National People's Congress (NPC). China will fully open its general manufacturing sector and expand foreign investment access to sectors like financial services, telecommunications and medical services, Li added. It will expand imports and lower import tariffs this year. The first China International Import Expo in November will bring more foreign goods to China. NPC deputy Ma Huateng, founder and chairman of tech giant Tencent, said having lived in Shenzhen for more than 30 years, he is a witness and beneficiary of the reform and opening up drive. Over the past four decades, Shenzhen has developed from a small fishing village to a metropolis. Ma's company has developed from one with only five members to one of the 10 biggest internet companies in the world. ""I hope technology and innovation can further push forward reform and opening up in the future,"" Ma said. Reform and opening up from the late 1970s resulted in the rise of the eastern and coastal areas of China, while deepened reforms today will spread to the central and western regions to ultimately achieve common prosperity for everyone. As the sluggish recovery of the global economy continues, China's persistent deepening of economic reforms will enhance its role as the driving force and stabilizer of the world economy, said Jiang Yuechun, an analyst with the China Institute of International Studies. BETTER-STRUCTURED GOV'T, NEW ANTI-GRAFT LAW In the political field, China has also shown its determination to deepen reforms. The State Council unveiled a massive cabinet restructuring plan on Tuesday, which was submitted to the NPC first session for review, pending approval. If passed, the cabinet would have 15 fewer entities at the ministerial or vice-ministerial levels. The move will make the government better structured, more efficient, and service-oriented. On Sunday, the national legislature adopted a constitutional amendment, which was the first amendment to the country's fundamental law in 14 years. Reform will carry on in the country's supervisory institutions. A draft supervision law was submitted for its third reading at the national legislature Tuesday. The supervision law is expected to serve as a fundamental and guiding law against corruption and for state supervision, said Li Jianguo, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC). New supervisory commissions, to be established at the national level and different local levels, will independently exercise supervisory power and will not be subject to interference from the government, social organizations or individuals. ""Reform in the supervisory system is a pioneering measure in China. The supervision law will provide crucial political and legal guarantee for the anti-corruption campaigns,"" said Xia Hongmin, an NPC deputy from southwest China's Guizhou Province. IMPROVED WELL-BEING China will advance institutional social reforms this year, covering old-age pensions, public hospitals and healthcare. More efforts will be made to boost employment, increase people's income, eliminate poverty and reduce disparities in urban-rural development. In the fight against poverty, China has set a goal for over 10 million people to be lifted out of poverty in 2018. The government will pay more attention to rural areas and give more support to areas affected by extreme poverty. According to the cabinet restructuring plan, a new ministry to push forward the development of the agricultural sector and rural areas will be formed. ""The move can incorporate resources in rural areas and those related to agriculture, and it favors further reforms in rural areas and can help solve problems related to agriculture, rural areas and farmers,"" said Lei Yanqin, an NPC deputy and also a township head from Jiangxi Province. ""Reforms in rural areas will bring more opportunities to rural residents and increase their income,"" Lei said. Reforms in education, culture and sports are also under way. Many places in China are still confronted with unbalanced educational development. To solve the problem, the government plans to promote the integrated development of urban and rural compulsory education, and will continue to weigh funding for education toward poor areas and weak links. China also plans to merge the Ministry of Culture and National Tourism Administration into a ministry of culture and tourism. The move is aimed at coordinating the development of the cultural and tourism industries, enhancing the country's soft power and cultural influence, and promoting cultural exchanges internationally, State Councilor Wang Yong said. ""The reform and opening up that started 40 years ago has created miracles in China. It has not only stimulated China's economy, but has also strengthened relations between China and the world. It has also injected vitality into the country's social development,"" said Huang Lihui, an NPC deputy. As a private entrepreneur, Huang said he is looking forward to seeing continuous deepening of reform in all respects and more preferential policies toward the private economy. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

A worker is working at an aluminum production plant in central Chinaâs Anhui province on Aug. 3, 2017. (Photo from CFP) The statement came after the US President Donald Trump signed proclamations to impose hefty tariffs on imported steel and aluminum amid mounting dissent from business groups and trading partners around the world. The majority of steel and aluminum imported by the US was for civilian use and by no means impairs its national security, stressed Wang Hejun, head of trade remedy and investigation bureau at the Ministry of Commerce. China strongly opposes the US plan, as its abuse of the ânational securityâ provision is a wanton sabotage of the multilateral trade system represented by the World Trade Organization, said Wang, adding that such kind of abuse will undermine the normal international trading order. China will take strong measures to defend its legitimate rights and interests after assessing the losses caused by the US measures, stressed Wang, adding that China has expressed its position and concerns, and lodged solemn complaints to the US side through multiple channels. What the measures damage is not only the interests of other countries, but also that of the US, Wang pointed out, stressing that it has incurred complaints from US congressman, industrial associations, as well as businesses.

China's move came after US President Donald Trump signed two proclamations on Thursday to levy a 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum while offering potential exemptions for Canada and Mexico. Trump said the penalties may ""go up or down depending on the country, and I'll have a right to drop out countries or add countries"". Wang Hejun, head of the trade remedy and investigation bureau of the Ministry of Commerce, said the US measures are in essence trade protectionism in the guise of national security. Most US steel and aluminum imports are for civil use and by no means impair US national security. Wang said the US abuse of the ""national security"" provision is a wanton sabotage of the multilateral trading system represented by the World Trade Organization, and is set to hurt the normal international trading order. ""China firmly opposes that,"" he said in a statement. ""China has lodged solemn complaints with the US side through multiple channels, and China will assess its losses caused by the US measures, as well as take strong actions to ensure its legitimate interests."" The US first announced the tariffs on March 1 after a US Commerce Department investigation under Section 232 of US Trade Expansion Act of 1962 found the imports threatening to US national security. The China Iron and Steel Association called on the Chinese government on Friday to retaliate against the US by targeting ""stainless steel products, galvanized sheet, seamless pipe, coal, agriculture products and electronic products"" imported from the US, it said in a statement posted on its website. Xu Xiangchun, chief analyst for Mysteel.com, an iron and steel industry consultancy website, said the US move would have a limited direct impact on China's steel industry because China has been exporting a fairly small amount of steel to the US in recent years. Chinese steel products are mostly used in the domestic market, rather than for exports, Xu said. China shipped a total of 75.43 million metric tons of steel to global markets in 2017, and the exports to the US accounted for only 1.18 million metric tons, while overall steel exports represented less than 10 percent of China's steel production, according to the National Development and Reform Commission and the General Administration of Customs.

[Photo/Agencies] After a week of hints and uncertainty, President Donald Trump said Thursday he would announce tariffs on imported steel and aluminum but with temporary exemptions for Canada and Mexico as he seeks to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. He suggested Australia and ""other countries"" might also be spared, a shift that could soften the international blow amid threats of retaliation by trading partners. Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports will take effect in 15 days, with Canada and Mexico indefinitely exempted from the duties, according to people outside the White House who were briefed on the plans Thursday. The people spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the president's signing of the orders. ""We're going to be very fair, we're going to be very flexible but we're going to protect the American worker as I said I would do in my campaign,"" Trump said during a Cabinet meeting. The president reiterated that he would levy tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum but would ""have a right to go up or down depending on the country and I'll have a right to drop out countries or add countries. I just want fairness.""The president indicated Canada and Mexico's treatment would be connected to the ongoing NAFTA talks, which are expected to resume in early April. The people briefed on the plans said all countries affected by the tariffs would be invited to negotiate with the Trump administration to be exempted from the tariffs if they can address the threat their exports pose to U.S. manufacturers. The people said the exclusions for Canada and Mexico could be ended if talks to renegotiate NAFTA stall. The process of announcing the penalties has been the subject of an intense debate and chaotic exchanges within the White House, pitting hard-liners against free trade advocates such as outgoing economic adviser Gary Cohn aiming to add more flexibility for U.S. trading partners. The fight over tariffs comes amid intense turmoil in the West Wing, which has seen waves of departures and negative news stories that have left Trump increasingly isolated in the Oval Office, according to two senior officials speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking. Trump was still hearing last-minute pleas from opponents of the tariff plan, and White House officials said they couldn't predict how the day would shake out. Steel and aluminum workers were invited to the White House for the afternoon announcement with Trump. Congressional Republicans and business groups are bracing for the impact of the tariffs and the departure of Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive who has opposed them. House Speaker Paul Ryan, appearing at a session with Home Depot employees in Atlanta, said ahead of Trump's announcement, ""I'm just not a fan of broad-based, across-the-board tariffs."" He pointed to the store's many products that rely on steel and aluminum. More than 100 House Republicans wrote Trump on Wednesday, asking him to reconsider ""the idea of broad tariffs to avoid unintended negative consequences"" to the U.S. economy and workers. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican, said he plans to introduce legislation next week to nullify the tariffs though he has acknowledged that finding the votes to stop the president's actions could be difficult. Business leaders, meanwhile, continue to sound the alarm about the potential economic fallout from tariffs, with the president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce raising the specter of a global trade war. That scenario, Tom Donohue said, would endanger the economic momentum from the GOP tax cuts and Trump's rollback of regulations. ""We urge the administration to take this risk seriously,"" Donohue said. The president has said the tariffs are needed to reinforce lagging American steel and aluminum industries and protect national security. He has tried to use the tariffs as leverage in ongoing talks to renegotiate NAFTA, suggesting Canada and Mexico might be exempted from tariffs if they offer more favorable terms under the trade agreement. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The stable development of Sino-U.S. ties serves the fundamental interests of people of both countries and is much anticipated by the international community, Zhang Yesui, former Chinese ambassador to the United States and spokesperson for the first session of the 13th National People's Congress, told a press conference. U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday that the United States would impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent for aluminum, raising concerns of escalating trade tension between the two countries. ""China doesn't want a trade war with the United States, but if any U.S. moves hurt China's interests, we will not sit idle,"" said Zhang. Zhang pointed out that certain frictions are natural given the huge bilateral trading volume, while economic and trade ties between the countries are essentially mutually beneficial. It's normal for China and the United States to have different ideas on certain issues, but such differences do not necessarily lead to confrontation, Zhang said. The right approach is to open up market to each other, make the pie of cooperation bigger and work together to find solutions acceptable to both parties through dialogue and consultation, Zhang added. Liu He, a senior Chinese economic and financial official met with U.S. counterparts this week and they have agreed that the two countries should settle their trade disputes by cooperation rather than confrontation. The two sides also agreed to talk about related issues in Beijing in the near future, in a bid to create conditions for further cooperation. It's imperative for two countries to perceive each other's strategic intentions objectively and accurately. Policies formed by misjudgment or wrong presumption will hurt the relations and bring about consequences neither side wants to see, he said.

(Xinhua/Liang Sen) BRUSSELS, March 2 -- U.S. President Donald Trump's planned tariffs on steel and aluminium has sparked anger in the European Union (EU) and the bloc has vowed to take retaliatory measures. Trump announced on Thursday that the United States is set to impose 25 percent of tariff on steel imports and 10 percent for aluminum. EU TO REACT FIRMLY Shortly after Trump's announcement, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker responded that the EU would ""react firmly and commensurately"" to defend its own interests. ""The Commission will bring forward in the next few days a proposal for World Trade Organization-compatible counter measures against the U.S. to re-balance the situation,"" he said. ""The EU has been a close security ally of the U.S. for decades. We will not sit idly while our industry is hit with unfair measures that put thousands of European jobs at risk. I had the occasion to say that the EU would react adequately and that's what we will do,"" Juncker added. European trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the U.S. measures would have a negative impact on transatlantic relations and on global markets. U.S.-EU trade relations will be affected by the additional import duties on steel and aluminum coming from the EU, said Fredrik Erixon, the director of the Brussels-based think tank, the European Center for International Political Economy. ""There are always some trade and economic frictions between them, but now that the U.S. says that one of its key allies can't export freely to the U.S. for reasons of national security, it is a slap in the face,"" Erixon said. ""And it adds to brewing disputes they have in competition and tax policy,"" he added. The Brussels-based expert said ""there isn't for the moment any real cooperation"" between the United States and the EU on trade policy, and with Trump's new move, ""we are sure to get that relation moving into one of confrontation"". GERMANY: UNACCEPTABLE German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel called for a strong EU response, saying the move from Washington was ""not at all acceptable"" and urging Trump to rethink the announcement. The EU ""must respond with determination to punitive U.S. tariffs that threaten thousands of jobs in Europe,"" Gabriel told a German newspaper. The EU steel industry groups are also critical. Trump has chosen ""global trade confrontation"", said Axel Eggert, director general of the European Steel Association (EUROFER). ""From one day to the next, EU steel exports to the U.S. -- which were at 5 million tonnes in 2017 -- will be severely hit,"" he said in a statement issued on Friday. ""President Trump has chosen the most disruptive option among those recommended by his secretary of commerce,"" he added. The Federation of German Industries (BDI) ""supports the EU in its plan to provide an appropriate response"", BDI President Dieter Kempf said in a statement on Friday. He warned a new wave of protectionism would quickly hit Germany as a trading nation. ""The foreclosure policy of the U.S. is a mistake. U.S. President Donald Trump risks global trade conflicts and a spiral of protectionism that will eventually cost American jobs,"" he added. Erixon said Trump was ""shooting himself in the foot"" as the newly-announced tariffs won't help the U.S. economy and may cause bigger job losses in sectors using steel. He noted that the previous steel tariffs in the U.S. led to a small increase in U.S. steel jobs, but far bigger losses of jobs in sectors using steel. Steel is an input good, and the cost of construction and car production will go up, making it more expensive to build new infrastructure and be globally competitive in the automobile sector, the economist added."

The ministry's comments came after the USTR delivered the 2018 Trade Policy Agenda and 2017 Annual Report to the US Congress on Wednesday, criticizing China, Russia and other countries for adopting what it called ""hostile policies"" in trade activities, while ignoring China's contributions to the global economy. ""The report disregards China's concrete achievement in developing a market-oriented economy in past years and the fact that China strictly kept its WTO accession promises,"" according to an official with the ministry's Department of American and Oceanian Affairs. The US document also said China ""is not a market economy and does not have the right to engage in government interference and intervention in market mechanisms, distorting market outcomes and undermining the World Trade Organization rules"". The ministry said the report rashly criticized China's economic model and related policies. China is seriously concerned about this situation, it added. ""China will not close the door to the world but will only create more spaces,"" the official said in a statement. ""Since its entry into the WTO, China has kept its promises on tariff cuts and market opening, stood against protectionism, improved protection of property rights, promoted fair competition and pushed forward economic globalization."" China's development has pushed the global economy, and its contribution to world economic growth exceeded 30 percent in 2017, government data show.

(Xinhua/Ting Shen) WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Donald Trump said here on Thursday that he would impose tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum products, in a move he said would protect U.S. industry, but which experts said could hurt U.S. producers and face legal challenges from trade partners. The United States is set to impose 25 percent of tariff on steel imports and 10 percent for aluminum, Trump said after a meeting with business executives. ""We'll be signing it next week. And you'll have protection for a long time in a while,"" said Trump. News of the tariffs immediately hit sentiment on the Wall Street, with the Dow slumping over 500 points, more than 2 percent, in late trading. Daniel Ikenson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, said on Thursday that trade restrictions could hurt U.S. producers by exposing them to competitions from foreign rivals with lower production costs capable of offering lower prices in the U.S. market. U.S. actions would face legal challenge by other World Trade Organization members, and they would also invite other members to invoke national security to protect favored industries, said Ikenson. European Union (EU)'s trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom has said that EU would seek retaliation measures if the Trump administration's 232 trade investigation brings damage to European steelmakers. It's still unknown whether Trump's announcement on Thursday refer to blanket tariffs for all countries. In April last year, Trump ordered the Commerce Department to study the impact of steel and aluminum imports on national security under seldom-used section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act. Two weeks ago, the Commerce Department unveiled its recommendations for Trump to restrict imports of steel and aluminium products due to national security concerns, which drew oppositions from U.S. lawmakers and businesses. According to the recommendations, the United States could introduce at least 24 percent tariff on all steel imports from all countries and at least 7.7 percent tariff on all aluminium imports from all countries. Trump's announcement on Thursday was higher than both recommendations. Wendy Cutler, former Acting Deputy U.S. Trade Representative and now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said ""the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum will also reverberate throughout the U.S. economy and possibly negate some of the benefits of the recent tax cuts."" ""Downstream users, such as the automotive, aircraft, and boat industries, will pay more for inputs,"" she said. ""This decision appears to closely reflect one of the Commerce Department's options for across the board action with no country exemptions, meaning it could also impact U.S. allies, including Japan, Korea, Canada and Mexico,"" she said. The Department of Defense (DoD) has cautioned against a backlash from U.S. allies like Canada and South Korea. ""DoD continues to be concerned about the negative impact on our key allies regarding the recommended options,"" Defense Secretary James Mattis said in a memo sent to the Commerce Department. In response, Canadian Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said that any U.S. tariff or quota imposed on Canada's steel industry would be ""unacceptable."" Canada is the largest steel exporter to U.S. market, with steel imports from Canada accounting for 16.1 percent of the U.S. total steel imports in 2017, according to data released by the U.S. Commerce Department. Brazil and South Korea ranked the second and third largest steel exporters, with their shares at 13 percent and 10,2 percent, respectively. Steel imports from China only accounted for 2 percent of the U.S. total steel imports last year. (Wang Naishui and Wang Wen in New York contributed to this story)"

Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi's visit has allowed the two sides to discuss bilateral ties and important international and regional issues of mutual concern, said foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang, who accompanied Yang in Washington DC on Saturday, the Xinhua News Agency reported. Yang said during meetings with US officials that China and the US could properly address bilateral trade through the two-way opening of markets, and ""make a bigger cake of cooperation,"" the report said. Yang visited the US from Thursday to Friday, and met US President Donald Trump on Friday. Trade negotiations and pushing forward Sino-US relations topped Yang's agenda, Wu Xinbo, director of Fudan University's Center for American Studies in Shanghai, told the Global Times on Sunday. Yang's visit reflects China's concerns over a possible trade war with the US after Washington recently increased pressure on Beijing, said Shi Yinhong, director of the Center for American Studies at Renmin University of China. He noted that this also shows China is actively pushing forward bilateral ties. During Yang's visit, the US agreed that China-US trade ties are significant, saying it is willing to work with China to fortify and seek to solve bilateral economic and trade issues in a more effective manner, Xinhua reported. However, the Trump administration in January approved a 30 percent tariff on imported solar panel components, with the rate declining over the next four years. Imported washing machines will also be subject to as much as 50 percent in tariffs for the next three years, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer announced in January. Industry insiders have interpreted the move as targeting China, as the country has been the biggest source of solar components to the US for years. ""We oppose the US' unilateral and protectionist approach and hope the country can deal with it prudently,"" Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said after the US move, adding that ""we will carry out trade remedies strictly in accordance with WTO rules and relevant Chinese laws."" Trump has to behave aggressively to show he is determined to protect US jobs and his country's economy, but fractious Sino-US economic relations will bring more harm to both countries and their peoples, said Bai Ming, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation. Not US' wish During talks with US officials, Yang also stressed China's commitment to the denuclearization of the peninsula, peace and stability, and the ultimate settlement of disputes through dialogue and consultations. The situation on the peninsula is improving after North Korea's top leader Kim Jong-un invited South Korean President Moon Jae-in to Pyongyang, a situation which does not fit into the US' wishes, Wu said. ""We're going to make it crystal clear that our military, the Japanese self-defense forces, our allies here in South Korea, all of our allies across the region, are fully prepared to defend our nations and to take whatever action is necessary to defend our homeland,"" US Vice President Mike Pence said in a Friday interview, the Yonhap News Agency reported. The US still did not realize its previous policy on the peninsula situation has failed because the interaction between North and South Korea is the main solution right now, Wu said. He added that the US may not give up and will continue to take measures to provoke the already easing peninsula tensions. Beijing is ready to maintain communication and coordination with Washington on the basis of mutual trust and respect, so as to seek a proper solution to the peninsula issue, Yang said. China has long been actively urging relevant parties on this issue to calm down and hold dialogues, but there's little China can do aside from that, Wu added. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Photo: AP Washington (People's Daily) -- Jinko Solar, the worldâs second-largest solar panel manufacturer, said that its board of directors had authorized the company to open a factory for âan advanced solar manufacturing facility in the US.â The solar company did not specify the size or location of its first planned US factory, but a local newspaper in Jacksonville, Florida, reported that the Chinese solar company was most likely entering a $410 million factory-building deal with the city. Although unofficial, Jinko has pledged to bring 400 jobs to the city by the end of the year, with the other 400 to be hired by the end of 2019. Plant construction is slated to begin mid-summer and could be finished by the end of next year. The company also did not explain a reason for the investment but said it would continue to âclosely monitor treatment of imports of solar cells and modules under the US trade laws.â The decision comes after US President Donald Trump said he would raise tariffs on solar panel imports from China. The US tariff hike on solar power equipment, which could be as high as 30 percent has been seen as a hit against Chinese companies. Made-in-China solar products accounted for 21 percent of the products used in the US in 2016, even after years of American anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations into Chinese companies.

The US government is obviously trying to attract manufacturing industries to return home with tax cuts and by tweaking international trade rules to increase local employment and close the wealth gap. The question is, would a reversal in the international division of labor in industry achieve these goals? Liu Jianli, an associate professor at the Institute of Industrial Economics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences institute of Industrial Economics (CASS), and senior editor with Economic Management Journal, recently shared her point of view with People's Daily. Her comments have been lightly edited and condensed. Unemployment The unemployment rate in the US has indeed been declining in recent years. There are several factors that drove the result. Above all, the impetus of the world economic recovery and the cycle of economic growth in the US market is driving the job market. Additionally, the financial and market environment is relatively stable in the country, which has attracted an influx of both funds and talent, forging the sustained growth of the service sector. Overall the years, a serviceâoriented industry structure has been established in the US. By August 2017, 80 percent of newly created positions were in the service sector, and 10 percent were contributed by mining and manufacturing industries. In particular, new jobs from the manufacturing increased merely 1.1 percent year-on-year, according the statistics from the United States Department of Labor. The US carrot-stick game has retained some investment in the manufacturing sector. In the short term, investors that chose to stay have created a small share of new jobs. But with a backdrop of lacking skillful industrial workers and high labor costs, thereâs little advantage for low-end manufacturing in the country. On the other hand, with accelerated development in technology, manufacturing positions are declining all over the world. Trump is facing an impossible mission to bring high-end manufacturing jobs back to the homeland. To quote Joseph Stiglitz, economist and professor at Columbia University, âIf manufacturing jobs do come back to the US they will be done by robots in high tech parts of the country rather than the Rust Belt states.â Meanwhile, for the few newly created manufacturing jobs, the US government has achieved this goal by preventing the enterprises from opening new factories overseas, which has directly pushed up the costs. Such costs will inevitably be passed on to consumers, and as a result, the welfare of price-sensitive low-income groups will pay a heavy price, while supportive companies will have lost their competitiveness due to the higher costs. Tax cuts The US personal income tax system has been target of criticism for its complexity. Even though the whole US economy may get a lift by the country's biggest tax overhaul in three decades, the middle class won't benefit as much as expected from the cut. The move to reduce the tax rate of overseas repatriation profits of multinational corporations (MNCs) to the tax rate range from 7 percent to 14.5 percent will stimulate the repatriation of the profits to some extent. The actual effectiveness depends on the investment opportunities in the US. On the corporate side, many analysts believe that after cutting the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, companies would invest more in the country and create more jobs. Meanwhile, the tax cut is going to have a big effect on deficits, and the government usually responds to deficits by cutting spending, which probably will make the middle class suffer the most. Historical data show that the previous tax cuts in the US have been accompanied by an increased in the level of inflation. Consumption and investment have not increased significantly after excluding inflation. Another result of tax cuts could be a deterioration of the governmentâs fiscal state in the short term. Taking the current debt status into account, a tax cut is a risky move. If neighboring countries follow the tax cuts, the actual effect might be greatly reduced. Trade protectionism The US government is committed to withdrawing from NAFTA. Its excuses are based on the belief that the US has not benefited much from the agreement, while job opportunities have been robbed by Mexicans. What the US government refuses to accept is the reality that with the increasing deployment of intelligent manufacturing, automation has replaced industrial workers, which is the major cause of fewer jobs in industry. In the first two decades of NAFTA's entry into force, the ""cost depression effect"" has resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs to Mexico. However, with the increasing popularity of intelligent manufacturing, automation has replaced industry transfer as a major cause of job losses. To make it worse, the US government has launched anti-immigration policies, which will not fix the problem of a shortage of industrial workers, but result in surging costs, even if tariff barriers were re-established and manufacturing was brought back the US by MNCs. Anti-free trade policies will cause trade-related employment to shrink and the impact will be apparent immediately. Currently, the US government dreams of negotiating a series of bilateral negotiations and removing barriers one by one, creating more opportunities for its manufacturing industries. Such a unilateral mindset will merely undermine the foundation of US international economic cooperation, because mutual benefits will always be the premise for effective international economic cooperation. Therefore, trade protectionism might run counter to the initial intention of improving the competitiveness of US industries. The gap to be filled With its main approach of reviving the manufacturing industry, the US government has not yet identified the right way to raise the income for those with low wages. If we look into the industrial structure, even if the manufacturing industry returns, the reality of the huge gap between the rich and the poor is too big to be changed. In terms of employment distribution, the service sector in the US accounts for more than 80 percent. In contrast, the manufacturing industry accounts for more than 10 percent. A repeal or reduction of the inheritance tax will result in the gap between the rich and the poor being passed down, forming an intergenerational pattern. Trade protection policy might result in low-priced products being kept out of the US market. As a result, the prices of US consumer goods and industrial products will face a new wave of rising prices. Low-income groups will be affected most, widening the gap between the rich and the poor.

The country is prepared to ""further open up in four aspects,"" including the financial, manufacturing and services sectors as well as strengthen intellectual property protection and expand imports, said Liu He, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the General Office of the Central Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs, who also led the Chinese delegation at the WEF meeting. Regulators may lower or cancel restrictions on foreign investors in the manufacturing and services sector, while also adopting a model of national-treatment-plus-negative-list on their entrance, Liu said. He also highlighted a potential tariff cut in auto imports in the next few years. Although Liu did not elaborate on the level of opening up which may go beyond international expectations, experts predicted that the financial sector may be the first beneficiary of the new policies. ""Compared with the level of opening-up in the manufacturing and services sectors, the financial sector, specifically the domestic securities market, lags significantly behind due to central regulators' concern over potential financial risks,"" Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute at Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Wednesday. The financial risks refer to the inflow of speculative foreign investors, which may deal a blow to the domestic capital market, prompting the sharp fluctuation of the yuan and eventually leading to an economic crisis, Dong said. In a similar vein, the rapid capital flight also put a strain on foreign reserves, he added. Opening up the financial sector can be considered a test of Chinese policy-makers' supervision and policy-making ability, Dong added. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Wang Hejun, director of the MOFCOM Trade Relief Investigation Bureau, said in a statement that the hope is that the US will restrain its trade restrictions and abide by multilateral trade rules so as to play a positive role in promoting global economic growth. China, as a member of World Trade Organization (WTO), will join hands with other member states to safeguard its interests, the statement added. The US has taken trade remedy measures on imported solar products and large washers in recent years in a bid to help or even overprotect its manufacturers, Wang pointed out. The stiff levies on all imported solar-energy components and washers was recently approved by the administration after a global investigation, and caused dissatisfaction from China. This US investigation has raised concerns among its trade partners, and is also strongly opposed by local governments and downstream firms, said the director, adding that such restrictions arbitrarily imposed by Washington would hinder solar development in the US, as well as hit the trade environment across the globe.

Australian Minister Concetta Fierravanti-Wells accused China of constructing âuseless buildingsâ and âroads to nowhereâ on South Pacific islands earlier this month. Samoaâs Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi on Jan. 12 said the criticism of Fierravanti-Wells is âinsultingâ to Pacific Island leaders, and could âdestroyâ Australiaâs relationship with the region.

And talking over our heads about our shortcomings isnât going to win them many friends here, either,â the newspaper said, adding that the road project aided by Australia in Vanuatu four years ago has become the butt of jokes. Tuilaepa introduced that Australia has promised a wholly-aided parliament building several years ago as a gift for the 50th anniversary of Samoaâs independence. However, the South Pacific Island was later requested to raise part of the funding by itself. âSuch practice is common for Australia, but China has always kept its promises,â Tuilaepa remarked. Tongaâs Minister of Justice Sione Vuna FÄâotusia noted Chinaâs aid for South Pacific countries on infrastructure construction is indeed boosting the local economy. China is a large economy, and Australia is not able to match it in every aspect, FÄâotusia noted, adding that it is good for Tonga to cooperate with China. On Jan. 11, two bridges in Fiji aided by China officially opened, largely improving the local traffic. Fijian newspaper Fiji Sun commented that Chinaâs assistance has brought significant benefits to Fijiâs economy and society. Back in 2014, Chinese leader has already expressed the sincere hope of China to share development experiences and results with South Pacific islands. China is willing to deepen the cooperation with these nations in the areas of trade, fishing, ocean development, resources, and infrastructure. In addition, the country has also adopted a tariff-free policy for 97% of the imported goods from the least-developed countries."

But trade experts and local media have warned that slapping high tariffs on imported solar products is likely to kill far more American jobs than it saves.

From next month, tariffs on 187 product categories such as baby formula, diapers, and Japanese toilet seats will be reduced from 17.3 percent to 7.7 percent on average, according to the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council. The reduction will meet increasing domestic demand, as it allows Chinese consumers to buy cheaper and high-quality products that cannot be currently produced at home. Lower tariffs will also boost domestic consumption as it encourages people to buy imported products at home instead of overseas, analysts say. Tariffs have been cut four times on imported consumer goods since 2015. It is hoped that lower tariffs will encourage more foreign brands to invest and open branches in China, said Wang Wei, a researcher with the Institute for Market Economy, Development Research Center of the State Council. The tariff reduction also reflects that Chinese companies are narrowing the gap with their foreign counterparts in terms of middle-and high-end consumer goods manufacturing. âThere is no need to protect the Chinese producers, who have already addressed their weakness through the supply-side structural reform,â said Zhang Jun, an economist with Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

John Brumby, national president of Australian China Business Council (ACBC) and the former Premier of Victoria, accepted an interview with Peopleâs Daily Online, Australia. Mr. Brumby said that Chinaâs ongoing reform is vital to the stability and prosperity of the global economy. China is the global leader in promoting free trade Mr. Brumby said that as the US withdraws from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), protectionism continues to rise around the world. As a result, China is playing a global leadership role through advocating free trade, multilateralism, and globalization. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is one particularly positive development and it has great potential to increase free trade across the Asia-Pacific region. Mr. Brumby emphasized that President Xi Jinpingâs speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year âwas a strong defense of the important of globalization and free trade.â Mr. Brumby argues that the global economy is more interconnected than ever before, and pointed out that China has become Australia's largest trading partner. âFor this reason, Chinaâs economic stability, and its continued willingness to open up, is crucial to future global stability and prosperity,â Mr. Brumby said. Australian companies eager to participate in the Belt and Road Initiative Even though the Australian Government has been slow to embrace the notion of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Australian businesses have been eager to embrace it. Australian companies have years of experience in major infrastructure development and Brumby believes they can make a crucial contribution to this global infrastructure project. With Chinaâs economy shifting to consumption-led growth, Chinaâs middle class is evidently growing. âWe also look forward to further improving investment protocols between our countries, and to increasing investment in both directionsâ Mr. Brumby said. The 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Australia means great potential for bilateral relations This year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Australia. In regards to future prospects for Australia-China relations, Mr. Brumby said that the Australia-China relationship goes much deeper than just investment and trade. Currently, Australia has over one million citizens with Chinese ancestry, over 160,000 Chinese nationals attending Australian universities, and over one million Chinese tourists visiting each year. China aims to built a moderately prosperous society in all respects by 2020. Mr. Brumby believes that such efforts should focus on quality of life, tackling health and environmental challenges, and building livable cities and communities. âFinally, after ten years of negotiations, Australia is very proud that the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA) was signed in 2015.â Mr. Brumby said that this has already had a large impact, with âalmost 95% of the goods traded between China and Australia being tariff-free.â var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

[Photo/Agencies] The fifth round of Brexit talks concluded on Thursday and brought nothing concrete but a ""disturbing deadlock"" to citizens along the English Channel, amid rising fears of ""no deal"" between the European Union (EU) and Britain. ""No major step forward in this week's Brexit talks ... (yet) we still have the common goal,"" said EU Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier in his joint press conference with British counterpart David Davis, asserting that doing things in right order is the key to Brexit talks' success, and EU-UK future relationship is definitely not the subject of the first negotiation session. ""We worked constructively this week. We clarified certain points. But without making any great steps forward. We still have a common goal: the desire to reach an agreement on the UK's withdrawal and to outline our future relationship, when the time comes,"" he told reporters. For his part, Davis urged the other 27 EU members to recognize the progress and achievements made in the past rounds of talks in the EU leaders' summit slated for Oct 19 in Brussels, which is a precondition for the start of the second negotiation session. At the beginning of his speech, Barnier made crystal clear that no sufficient progress in three key fields -- citizens' rights, Northern Ireland border and financial settlement -- and no talks on the future relationship between EU and Britain. ""For us, from the EU side, achieving and realizing these three big objectives is the condition for engaging in a discussion, as soon as possible, on a new ambitious, long-lasting partnership,"" he said. Concerning the issue of citizens' rights, the two sides were still at loggerheads with each other. The only silver-line of the sitzkrieg was that Britain had informed EU of its intention to put in place a simplified procedure which allows EU citizens to assert their rights. ""Today I can confirm that we want to reassure those European citizens living in the UK that their rights and status will be enshrined in UK law by the Withdrawal Agreement. And yes, there will be a registration process but the administration process will be completely new. It will be streamlined, and it will be low cost,"" said Davis. ""We will study attentively the practical details of this procedure, which should really be simple for citizens,"" Barnier responded. As for the Northern Ireland border issue, the talks were currently on a right path but more work needs to be done. ""This week we advanced on the joint principles on the continuation of the Common Travel Area, and we continued our intensive work on mapping out areas of cooperation that operate on a North-South basis on the island of Ireland ... but more work to do in order to build a full picture of the challenges to North-South cooperation resulting from the Brexit,"" said Barnier. Both sides agreed a lot, but mainly in principle, without breakthrough again. As to the financial settlement, or the divorce fee, the two sides stuck in a deadlock. ""The UK told us again this week that it still could not clarify these commitments. Therefore, there was no negotiation on this, but we did have technical discussions which were useful, albeit technical. We are, therefore, at a deadlock on this question,"" said Barnier, adding that ""this is extremely worrying for European taxpayers and those who benefit from EU policies."" For EU, divorce fee is the precondition for talks on EU-UK future relationship, but for Britain, divorce fee is the bonus of the early starting of the talks on future relationship. In their speeches, both Davis and Barnier referred to British Prime Minister Theresa May's speech in Florence last month, which they believed brought a new dynamic to the talks in Brussels. ""The Prime Minister's speech set out the scale of our ambition for our deep and special partnership with the European Union ... I hope the leaders of the 27 will provide Michel with the means to explore ways forward with us on that and to build on the spirit of cooperation we now have,"" said Davis. For Barnier's part, May's speech strengthened his belief that ""with political will, decisive progress is within our reach in the coming weeks,"" he said, asserting that ""the agreement that we are working towards will not be built on 'concessions'... but shared objectives, obligations, duties and solutions."" But Barnier's remarks about concessions appeared to be nothing but a paronomasia, as it was the absence of concessions that made him ""not able to recommend to the European Council next week to open discussions on the future relationship."" In the middle of the fifth round talks, President of the European Council Donald Tusk said on his twitter account Tuesday that EU27 are not working on a ""no deal"" scenario in their Brexit talks with Britain. ""We negotiate in good faith and hope for 'sufficient progress' by December,"" he said. Tusk's remarks came a day after May told Britain to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. Addressing MPs in the House of Commons on the first day back after the conference season, May said achieving a special partnership after Brexit will require leadership and flexibility, not just from Britain, but from the 27 nations of the EU. ""As we look forward to the next stage, the ball is in their court. But I am optimistic it will receive a positive response,"" May told MPs in her first parliamentary statement since her big speech in Florence. ""What we are seeking is not just the best possible deal for us, but I believe that will also be the best possible deal for our European friends too. Progress will not always be smooth but by approaching these negotiations in a constructive way in a spirit of friendship and cooperation and with our sights firmly set on the future, I believe we can prove the doomsayers wrong,"" May added. In her statement, May said the British government had on Monday published two new policy consultation statements on trade and customs. ""These pave the way for legislation to allow the UK to operate as an independent trading nation and to create an innovative customs system that will help us achieve the greatest possible tariff and barrier-free trade as we leave the EU,"" said May. Also on Monday, the fifth round of Brexit negotiation started in Brussels. With the absence of Britain's Davis, the two sides kicked off their talks in a low profile -- no joint press conference. Prior to her speech in the House of Commons, May told the other 27 members of the Union that ""the ball is in the EU's court,"" calling on EU to take actions and exert more flexibility and imagination in the negotiations. Answering the question of a British reporter about ""the ball is in whose court,"" Margaritis Schinas, European Commission (EC) chief spokesperson, told reporters during Monday's daily briefing in the headquarters of the EC that ""This is not exactly a ball game."" ""You know we don't provide comments on comment, but what I can remind you is that there is sequencing of these talks,"" he said. ""There is no solution found so far to the step one, that is the divorce proceedings, so the ball is entirely in the UK's court for the rest to happen,"" said Schinas. The long-awaited Brexit talks was launched on June 19, nearly one year after Britain voted to leave the bloc by a narrow margin on June 23, 2016. May sent a notification letter to the EU in late March, triggering a two-year countdown to Britain's withdrawal of the bloc after more than 44 years of membership. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, responded to May's speech by saying that 16 months on after the referendum, no significant progress has been made. The government is no closer to deciding what it wants, said Corbyn. May's statement came as the fifth round of negotiations between Britain and the EU started in Brussels. Brexit Secretary David Davis sat alongside May as she delivered her statement, with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson seated some distance away.

The14th China-ASEAN Expo opened Tuesday, highlighting trade and investment among China, ASEAN and other countries along the Belt and Road. (Xinhua/Zhou Hua) NANNING, Sept. 13 (Xinhua) -- At Puzhai Port, a trade zone bordering Vietnam in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, trucks carrying dragon fruit, durian and other tropical fruit passing through the streets of one of the busiest trade hubs in the region. Most commodities traded here are tariff-free thanks to a free trade agreement that went into effect in 2010. The China-Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free Trade Area (FTA), the largest regional FTA in the world in terms of population, has reduced tariffs on more than 90 percent of goods traded between ASEAN and China to zero. An updated version of the FTA is expected to further facilitate trade, scale up bilateral investment, and encourage technological cooperation. ""The protocol on upgrading the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area has already been signed and put into effect, and will inject new impetus to bilateral economic and trade development,"" Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli said. He made the remarks at the opening of the ongoing 14th China-ASEAN Expo and the China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit in the provincial capital Nanning. Building on the existing FTA framework, the upgrade further reduces trade restrictions that some ASEAN members imposed on certain service sectors, simplifies customs procedures, and encourages companies to explore new opportunities arising from e-commerce. The implementation of the upgrade will help China and ASEAN move closer toward realizing the goal of scaling up two-way trade to 1 trillion U.S. dollars by 2020, Brunei's Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah said at the expo. Since its establishment, the FTA has strengthened trade ties between China and ASEAN. China has been ASEAN's biggest trading partner for eight years, while ASEAN has been China's third largest trading partner for six years. According to Xu Ningning, vice secretary-general of China-ASEAN Business Council, the FTA has served as a model for regional economic integration especially at a time when protectionism is rising in some Western countries. At the expo, some companies said they have already felt the convenience brought by the upgraded FTA. According to Li Chuanren, general manager of Guangxi Overland Total Logistics, a firm that offers two-way logistics services between Southeast Asia and China, simpler and transparent customs clearance procedures have saved the company at least 60 percent of the required time. ""When you make the process digital, it's easier for companies to manage their time and inventory levels. It's also easier for regulators to manage all the data,"" Li said. With increasing trade opportunities between ASEAN and China, Li said the company has seen a 15-percent rise on average in terms of business orders in the past few years. It's not only trade that the FTA is trying to promote. According to Xu, it also encourages deeper investment collaboration that brings mutual benefits. As ASEAN countries are pushing for urbanization and industrialization, they have an urgent need for funding as well as technology, which turns out to be China's advantage, Xu said. According to data from China's Ministry of Commerce, the cumulative two-way foreign direct investment (FDI) between China and ASEAN has reached 185 billion U.S. dollars. In the first seven months this year, China invested 4.82 billion U.S. dollars into ASEAN. The upgraded FTA also encourages all parties to share information and expertise on issues related to e-commerce. In response, a China-ASEAN cross-border e-commerce platform was established in late 2016. In about three months, the website has attracted 135 ASEAN companies, with 646,000 orders placed during the period. ""The construction of the China-ASEAN FTA has enabled the two sides to share a common market of more than 2 billion people. In the future, the Belt and Road Initiative will bring bilateral ties closer while people-to-people exchanges will be more convenient, said Zhai Kun, a professor of international relations at Peking University."

This year in Xiamen, trade and investment are high on the agenda. Delegations covering energy, ecommerce, food, manufacturing, transportation, infrastructure and other sectors gathered to look at how BRICS countries can deepen trade ties within the bloc.

""In terms of trade and investment, it was suggested at the forum that BRICS countries should raise the level of freedom. It's also agreed that in the sphere of commerce, BRICS should strengthen cooperation between government and social capital; policies should be made to facilitate capacity collaboration and communications of businessmen. Cooperation on market construction, tariff and eco-commerce development is also mentioned at the meeting."" Svetlana Chupsheva is the general director of the Russian Agency for Strategic Initiatives. She says Russia, as an example of BRICS's openness to trade and investment, has been striving to support various forms of businesses in recent years. ""We are working hard on the elimination on business barriers. We have proposed quite a few measures for that in such spheres as migration, customs regulatory measures and infrastructure. During the past few years Russia did a lot to improve its investment environment. From 2011 to up until now, Russia's position in the World Bank business rating has risen from the 120th place to 40th. This happened thanks to an active participation of businessmen in the process of eliminating barriers on trade and investment. South Africa, center of the African commerce industry, has also been maintaining openness within the BRICS bloc when it comes to mutual trade and investment. Sunil Geness, chairperson of the Deregulation Working Group of South Africa, says the perfect example is South Africa's trade relation with China. ""South Africa and China have already bilateral agreements that has been put in place. The way to increase is to ensure more flexible trade opportunities. This is made by governments and WTO level. And in business, what we want to see is the environment that is easy to register business and we can access to the investment promotion agencies and organizers of businesses in China more easily, which I see is happening.

(Xinhua/Ju Peng) BEIJING, Sept. 4 -- International scholars and experts have highly commented on the speech delivered by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the opening ceremony of the BRICS Business Forum in southeast China's Xiamen City on Sunday. Xi said in the speech that there are three important practices that should be carried forward in reviewing the past progress of BRICS cooperation -- first, treating each other as equals and seeking common ground while shelving differences; second, taking a results-oriented, innovative approach to make BRICS cooperation benefit all; and third, developing BRICS itself to help others with the well-being of the world in mind. The three important practices have been summarized as the three-point BRICS spirit. ""The three-point BRICS spirit reflects the state of regional and international equations, as well as the state of development in the BRICS countries,"" said B. R. Deepak, Sinologist and professor at the Center of the Chinese and Southeastern Asian Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University of India. ""I believe it's also in sync with China's foreign policy goals, as China has advocated that irrespective of differences in social systems, level of development, and the size of countries we must treat each other as equal, seek commonalities and reserve differences, BRICS not being an exception,"" said Deepak. ""This would enable the members to minimize their differences and maximize political trust... the spirit of BRICS will foster partnership rather than building alliances, it will foster dialogue over confrontation,"" said Deepak. ""The three-point BRICS spirit certainly provided some answers to our common problems,"" said Deepak. The three-point spirit is very crucial for the establishment of any effective partnership, said Stephen Ndegwa, lecturer at Multimedia University and public policy analyst in Kenya. The three-point spirit for BRICS stressed by Xi is very important for BRCIS countries' vision to support world peace and stability better and keep consistency when they strive for their development goals, said Gerishon Ikiara, lecturer of International Economics lecturer at University of Nairobi. Each point of the spirit is very important, as the world peace and security is currently under threat, said Ikiara, adding that the BRICS countries are playing a more important role in world affairs. Earlier before the BRICS Business Forum opened, Brazil economist Ronnie Lins told Xinhua in Brazil that the BRICS Business Forum would be a very important sideline event when the BRICS Summit was held in Xiamen, which aims to strengthen exchanges and dialogue among business leaders of BRICS countries and enhance trade among BRICS members. He said that the BRICS Business Forum in Xiamen, the largest one in the BRICS history, was sure to score positive outcomes. At the forum, President Xi called on the BRICS bloc to expand the coverage of its cooperation, and that can only benefit the people of those countries, said Iqbal Surve, chairman of South Africa BRICS Business Council. Also speaking of the BRICS spirit proposed by Xi at the BRICS Business Forum, Singaporean economist Koh Chin Yee said that it is very important for BRICS countries to treat each other as equals, seek common ground and shelve differences, as there are discrepancies, differences and competitions among BRICS countries. China is a very active and influential member of BRICS, which is pushing ahead the construction of BRICS mechanism, and China's role is very weighty in BRICS, he said. Li Renliang, professor at Thailand's National Institute of Development Administration, said Xi's speech reflected China's willingness to strengthen and deepen cooperation within the BRICS mechanism. Li also said BRICS countries, in the past 10 years, carried out effective cooperation based on the principle of equality in such major global affairs as climate change, U.N. reform and poverty reduction. BRICS is more than a mechanism, Li said, it is a bridge for South-North dialogue and South-South cooperation. The reality that the BRICS countries are of different national situations, at different stages of development and of various cultures and faiths does not have a negative impact on their practical cooperation. Instead, it has boosted the principle of ""seeking common ground while shelving differences"" and encourages sound cooperation between the five countries in the past 10 years, he said. Guo Shengxiang, dean of the Academy of APECCreative Finance, an Australian think tank, listed that over the past decade, the BRICS countries have contributed more than half of global growth, and that their total volume of trade and overseas investment accounts for 16 percent and 12 percent of the world's total, up from 11 percent and 7 percent in 2006. The numbers testify to the importance of the supporting role the mechanism has played for other developing countries as a whole, he said. Meanwhile, all being developing countries, the five have common interests in lower tariffs, less tariff barriers and more feasibility in global trade and investment, Guo said. Therefore, there is a sound foundation for their cooperation in tariff and fee reform, according to him."

""As part of that effort, BRICS members will discuss establishing free trade zones during the upcoming summit."" The BRICS Summit will be held in Xiamen, Fujian province, from Sunday to Tuesday. Ye said the idea of setting up such zones among those countries is ""preliminary"". There is no specific timetable yet. ""Member countries can start by lowering trade barriers under the WTO framework, gathering some experience for establishing free trade zones."" Bai Ming, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, a think tank under the Ministry of Commerce, said it may take a long time to get the idea off the groundï¼it is a big challenge to balance the interests of members that have all joined other regional groups and alliances. Bai cited the example of Brazil, a member of Mercosur, a common market in Latin America. The regional bloc's members have eliminated all tariff barriers that could affect their economies and apply a common external tariff to nonmember economies. ""Brazil needs to seek the consensus of other members (of Mercosur) before getting involved in a new free trade alliance,"" he said. Bai said BRICS can speed up the process by inviting nonmembers into the discussion of building free trade zones. They might be trade partners of BRICS countries, who are expected to have interests similar to those of BRICS members. This year, China came up with the idea of extending the partnerships of BRICS and widening the circle by inviting other developing countries under a new banner, BRICS Plus. Five nonmember countriesï¼Egypt, Guinea, Mexico, Tajikistan and Thailandï¼will attend the summit as guests. Improving BRICS trade facilitation is a practical step that can be taken in the short run, at a time when trade frictions are common among its members, according to Feng Xingke, deputy secretary-general of Tsinghua University's BRICS Economic Think Tank. While friction is quite normal among emerging economies and can be properly solved via the WTO, it means the countries can only gradually turn cooperative visions into practical steps, Feng said.

Tariffs on frozen beef from the affected regions will be raised from the current 38.5 percent to 50 percent from August 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018, according to the government. The so-called safeguard mechanism, aimed at protecting Japanese cattle farmers, was triggered by a surge in frozen beef imports in the April to June quarter which, according to government data, reached 89,253 tons, up 17.1 percent from a year earlier. Under World Trade Organization rules, Japan is allowed to activate the safeguard mechanism when the volume of beef import grows more than 17 percent from a year earlier on a quarterly basis. As Australian beef is exempted from the emergency measure due to a bilateral free trade agreement, the U.S., as the second largest supplier of frozen beef to Japan following Australia, is to be the major country affected by the tariff hike. U.S. Meat Export Federation President Philip Seng reportedly said that the tariff hike ""will not only have negative implications for U.S. beef producers, but will also have a significant impact on the Japanese food-service industry."" Japan's farm minister Yuji Yamamoto told reporters on Friday that the measures would only have ""limited effects"" on ordinary consumers as frozen beef affected by the emergency measure accounts for only 20 percent of Japan's total beef imports. Japan's deputy prime minister Taro Aso said that he is ready to discuss the emergency measure at an economic dialogue with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence scheduled later this year. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The country should ""create a stable, fair, transparent and predictable business environment, and speed up efforts to build an open economy in a bid to promote the sustainable and healthy development of the Chinese economy,"" Xi said at a meeting of the Central Leading Group on Finance and Economic Affairs. An important goal of building an open economy is to stimulate improvement of domestic institutions and laws for higher efficiency and greater competitive strength in the global market, said the president. Foreign investment has played a significant role in China's economic development, promoting reasonable allocation of resources and driving market-oriented reforms, he told the meeting. China should continue to make good use of foreign investment to advance supply-side structural reforms, upgrade the economy, and catch up with global technology development, Xi said. He urged faster efforts to lift restrictions on foreign access to and ownership in sectors such as child care, elderly care, architectural design, accounting, auditing, commerce, logistics, e-commerce, general manufacturing and services. The ""negative list"" approach on foreign investment management, which has been adopted in the country's pilot free trade zones, should be expanded to the whole nation as soon as possible, he said. A negative list approach identifies sectors and businesses that are off-limits or restricted for investment. Xi also called for faster work to unify laws and regulations on domestic and foreign businesses and make new fundamental laws on foreign investment. Laws, rules, and policies out of tune with the overall direction and principle of opening up should be abolished or revised within a time limit, and national treatment in laws and policies should be granted to foreign-funded companies after they enter the market, the president said. Xi urged megacities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen to take the lead in improving business environment, demanding moves to reduce inspections and fines on companies and ban illegal fee charging. He stressed the importance of protecting intellectual property rights (IPR), calling on authorities to better laws and regulations, improve the quality and efficiency of intellectual property examinations, and speed up institutional improvement for IPR protection related to emerging sectors and new business types. Wrongdoing should be punished more severely so that IPR infringers will pay heavy prices, said the president. Speaking of the financial sector, Xi said those areas that help protect consumers' rights and interests, promote orderly competition, and prevent financial risks should be opened up faster. He demanded efforts to advance opening-up of the capital account in an orderly manner, and steadily push the yuan to become an international currency. The yuan's exchange rate formation mechanism should be improved, and the currency's value should be kept basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level, Xi said. To keep up with the pace of financial opening up, China must have a strong regulatory capability, the president noted. He urged financial regulators to learn from international experience, address weak links and improve the way of regulation. On foreign trade, Xi stressed expanding imports while stabilizing exports to promote balance of payment under the current account. He demanded measures to make foreign trade more liberalized and convenient, saying institutional costs of import should be lowered, quarantine and custom clearance be streamlined, and that companies' complaints be better addressed. Authorities must study reducing tariffs on certain consumer goods and encourage the import of specialty products, Xi said. A market environment featuring fair play should be created in the country, giving businesses equal treatment in tariff collection, import quarantine and marketing to let consumers and the market have the say, according to the president, who is also head of the leading group. The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang, who is deputy head of the group, and Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, a member of the group."

Although the negotiations were not always smooth, the result was basically ""satisfying"" with consensus reached on a variety of issues. For instance, the G20 members unanimously voiced support for globalization, opposed trade protectionism, committed themselves to open markets and decided to establish a stable international trade system to promote transnational investment. However, differences were highlighted as much as the consensus that was achieved at the summit. ""You can notice that controversies within the G20 are substantial about trade and climate change, even about multilateralism itself,"" said Dr. Dirk Messner, director of the German Development Institute and co-chairman of Think 20, a think tank for the G20. German Chancellor Angela Merkel conceded at a press conference following the end of the summit that negotiations on free trade proved to be very difficult. Shi Shiwei, a professor from Free University of Berlin who specializes in China-Germany economy and trade, said that it was indeed ""a major achievement to forge a consensus on free trade at the Hamburg Summit when the United States explicitly underscores trade protectionism and adopts an 'America First' policy."" But Shi also pointed out it's not hard to see rifts and compromises among various parties from the communique adopted at the conclusion of the two-day meeting. On trade and investment, the communique said the G20 leaders pledge to ""recognize the role of legitimate trade defense instruments in this regard."" Commenting on this, Shi said, ""this is a compromise made to U.S. President Donald Trump."" In the meantime, where combating climate change is concerned, different camps remain within the G20 bloc and the divides there are hard to bridge. The communique pointed to the U.S. decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement while the rest of the G20 members described the pact as ""irreversible"" and reaffirmed their commitment to the climate deal. The Financial Times commented that the ""unanimous G20 communique fails to hide U.S. tension,"" saying the G20 nations put on a face-saving show of unity by negotiating a joint declaration despite the deep divisions on trade and on climate change driven by Trump's ""America First"" approach. ""The 'Trump effect' will become the biggest uncertainty for global governance in the future,"" Shi said. At the summit Trump did not make much concessions on such issues as globalization and climate change and maintained his basic stand, Shi said. While Trump was left somewhat isolated in Hamburg and was even positioned on the left fringe of the ""family photo,"" the anti-globalization trend that prevails in Trump's administration, the United States as well as the world at large is not on the ebb. German local media outlets believe this willful president will surely make more trouble for future global governance. Some are concerned the wording of ""legitimate trade defense instruments"" included in the communique poses the potential threat that some countries may impose punitive duties under that excuse, like a 20 percent tariff now being considered by the Trump administration against steel imports. True, the world faces far more challenges than that. Volatility in financial markets, climate change and imbalances and unfairness in development remain problems confronting global governance, said Messner. An unreasonable global financial architecture and lack of coordination in governance bring many risks and challenges to global governance, Shi added. However, despite all the divisions, the G20 is still playing a crucial role in global governance. ""The G20 is even more important, and we need to rebuild it,"" Messner said. The G20 represents 80 percent of the global gross domestic product (GDP), 80 percent of global trade and 80 percent of global resources and consumption. ""If the G20 can't solve our global problems, no one else can solve them,"" Messner said. ""They are responsible."""

Gathering economic experts from China and abroad, the Globalization Vs De-globalization forum came in the wake of US reports that the Trump administration is considering slapping a 20-percent tariff on foreign steel products. That has worried big steel exporter China, a country whose army of cheap laborers has been accused of helping reduce employment opportunities in the US and other Western countries. However, Donald Trumpâs opposition to globalization is futile, many believe. The US leader has promised to bring jobs back to America, âbut those jobs are already gone,â according to Liu Ningrong, deputy director of Hong Kong University Space. It is inevitable that globalization leads to an international division of labor based on economic principles, Liu said at the forum. He compared the return of trade protectionism in America to a similar movement there before the Great Depression, and said these policies did not work. (Delegates said globalization will inevitably lead to an international division of labor. /CGTN Screenshot) For the past several decades, China has been receiving jobs outsourced by globalization as a low-cost manufacturer. With wages rising in China, it is natural that simple, low-wage economic activities will now flow to other developing economies, said Professor Jerry Friedman from Harvard University.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross labeled China as ""the most highly protectionist of the big countries"" in his recent interview with the Wall Street Journal. His China-bashing rhetoric, however, was refuted by two economists with Peterson Institute For International Economics (PIIE). In an online article recently published on PIIE website, senior fellow Nicholas Lardy and research analyst Zixuan Huang argued that Ross's accusation was outdated and neglected the progress China had made over the last three decades. ""China was a highly protectionist trading nation three decades ago, before it initiated negotiations to join the World Trade Organization (WTO). But to qualify for entry and to fulfill its WTO commitments after entry, China drastically reduced its average statutory tariff from about 45 percent in the mid-1980s to only 10 percent in 2015,"" said the article.

The electric-car manufacturer said in an emailed statement that it expects to âmore clearly define its plans for producing electric vehicles in China by the end of the year.â Under the current regulations, a local partner is required for Tesla to establish a manufacturing center in China. âTesla is deeply committed to the Chinese market, and we continue to evaluate potential manufacturing sites around the globe to serve the local markets,â Tesla said in the statement. Tesla didnât mention with whom it will partner, and speculation lingers after two rumored candidates officially denied that they had any contact with Tesla. Shanghai Lingang Holdings Co. Ltd. dismissed previous media reports late on June 22, saying that the Lingang development zone will not be home to the upcoming China factory, since it has neither been in contact with Tesla nor reached a deal on a factory. Shanghai Electric Group followed with a similar statement. Teslaâs announcement came days after U.S. automaker Ford announced plans to shift some production of its Focus model to China starting in 2019, a move that was deemed an act of defiance against the Trump administration's âAmerica firstâ doctrine. U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer said on June 22 that he was troubled by Fordâs move, and vowed to take countermeasures if the shift was planned for non-economic reasons. Tesla, meanwhile, promised that most of its production will stay in the United States, its most important market which provided $4.2 billion of the company's $7 billion 2016 revenue. China narrowed the gap last year after sluggish sales throughout 2015. In a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Tesla recognized that the Chinese market contributed over $1 billion in 2016, with at least 11,000 vehicles ordered. The new factory would theoretically boost Tesla's China sales by eliminating a 25 percent import tariff that made its vehicles pricier in China than in U.S. markets."

Both gave keynote speeches saying how they would approach Britain's departure from the European Union. May's message that no Brexit deal is better than a bad deal, earned a response from Corbyn saying: ""no deal is a bad deal."" With one of the latest opinion polls giving May's Conservative Party a narrow three-point lead over Labour, Corbyn's party is now scenting it is within grasp of beating May in next Thursday's general election. In what will be seen as a major blow for the Conservatives, the London Evening Standard said Thursday night that in a shock surge, Corbyn was now more popular in London than May. The newspaper, edited by former Chancellor George Osborne, the politician fired by May last year, said for the first time, more voters in the capital say they think the Labour leader would make a better Prime Minister than May. It said the Conservative's hopes of gaining seats in London have been dashed by a huge 17-point lead opening up for Labour,and instead May's party could lose seats. At her election rally in Middlesborough in north east England, May was asked how the lead if 24 points she had at the start of the campaign was now down to just three points in one poll. Corbyn, meanwhile, was asked a similar question, with both declining to speculate on numbers by pollsters, saying the June 8 poll was the one that mattered. In her speech May set out her vision of Brexit as part of a great national mission to build a ""stronger, fairer and more prosperous Britain,"" insisting that vision could only be delivered if voters backed her in the June 8 vote. ""If they do, I am confident that we can fulfil the promise of Brexit together and build a Britain that is stronger, fairer and even more prosperous than it is today. I will work every day to make a success of Brexit, and will strive to be a leader worthy of a Great Britain,"" she said. May repeated her promise to respect the decision of the British people who voted a year ago in a national referendum to leave the EU. Labour's Corbyn saying he was ""simply not up to the job"". May, spelling out what the dire consequences of getting Brexit negotiations wrong, said there are people elsewhere in the EU who want to punish the UK and those who are willing to sign up to a deal whatever the price of that deal. ""They would end up with the worst possible deal at the highest possible price,"" she said, In a second speech, also in northern England, May Theresa May told supporters that is she loses lose just six seats her government would lose its majority. In his keynote speech in Basildon, Corbyn the British people have a choice in the election over which team they trust to lead the difficult negotiations ahead. ""We will confirm to the other member states that Britain is leaving the European Union. But, instead of posturing threats and pumped up animosity, a Labour Government under my leadership, will set out a plan for Brexit based on the mutual interests of both Britain and the EU."" He said Labour will give a clear commitment to the 3 million EU nationals living and working in Britain that they can stay. He added that Britain also needs tariff-free access to European markets.

Chinese Vice-Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao disclosed that China plans to resume imports of US beef by July 16, exactly 100 days after Chinese President Xi Jinping met US President Donald Trump in Florida. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer welcomed the agreement at a news conference. Meanwhile, Australia, China's top beef importer, is watching the beef market with great concern. Several Australian media outlets even reported plans to support industries related to beef export in the country. Statistics showed that last year the gap between supply and demand in domestic beef market was 830,000 tons, which is expected to be filled as US beef re-enters the Chinese market. Gao Guan, vice-secretary-general of the China Meat Association, told National Business Daily that price is one of the biggest competitive advantages of US beef. Due to the low cost of raising cattle, the final retail price of US beef in China is still lower than domestically-produced beef even plus tariff and added-value tax. ""No matter how the beef market changed, the biggest winner will be customers."" China banned US beef in 2003 after a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, in Washington state. Since the ban was introduced, China has experienced a beef boom. Ministry of Agriculture data shows that 8 million tons of beef was consumed last year, with a market value of 360 billion yuan. In 2016, beef output rose 2.4 percent to 7.17 million tons from 7 million tons a year earlier. The gap between demand and supply was 830,000 tons. China is filling the gap by increasing imports. Last year, 600,000 tons of beef was imported, a 22 percent increase from a year earlier. China's enormous beef market has prompted Brazil and Australia to try to increase their market share amid fierce competition. According to MIG Group, Brazil became China's biggest beef importer in January last year, with market share rising to 33 percent from 13 percent in 2015. Australia is suffering from a drought that is hurting beef production.

As ASEAN turns 50 this year, the world seems to turn away from globalization as seen in Brexit and the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, what should ASEAN do next? Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, which chairs the ASEAN summit in Manila this year, earlier laid out several areas as priorities to be discussed with ASEAN leaders, which include peace and stability in the region, maritime security and cooperation, and ASEAN as a model of regionalism and a global player. But to build ASEAN into a model of regionalism still faces uncertainties. ""The agenda for the ASEAN community this year is unfortunately stale,"" said Shahriman Lockman, a senior analyst with the Institute of Strategic and International Studies based in Kuala Lumpur. ""Most of the easiest measures -- the so-called 'low-hanging fruits' -- have already been adopted,"" he said. On top of the most difficult issues left for ASEAN to tackle are non-tariff barriers (NTBs) and non-tariff measures (NTMs), which hinder trade despite the general slashing of tariffs in recent decades. According to the study of Lockman, the number of NTBs and NTMs have in fact increased from 1,639 measures in 2000 to 5,975 in 2015. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, when attending a forum on the sideline of the summit in Manila on Friday, said for ASEAN's economy to achieve the 9.2-trillion-U.S.-dollar figure by 2050, there has to be a 20 percent reduction in fixed trade costs. From the global perspective, ASEAN is faced with the alternative as to whether to embrace globalization, or as some have suggested to take cue from Brexit and adopt a wait-and-see stance. Abdul Majid Ahmad Khan, former Malaysian ambassador to China, said one major task for the 10 ASEAN leaders at the summit is to discuss how to deal with Trump, who since his campaign to election, has been sending a signal to turn away from globalization and to abandon multilateralism to focus on unilateralism or bilateral negotiations. ASEAN, from the start, has been a multilateralism-based organization, said Majid, adding ASEAN countries have shown some concerns for the rise of protectionism and globalization backlash. Joey Concepcion, a business advisor to Duterte, said Trump's plan to bring back jobs is at the expense of consumers' benefits. After the United States announced its formal withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), ASEAN countries, among which four countries - Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam - are also TPP participants are the first to call for the promotion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). It is believed that ASEAN would like to conclude negotiations of RCEP in 2017 to coincide with its 50th anniversary, but still, some analysts urged for cautious optimism. ""There's also been a growth in protectionist sentiments in several ASEAN countries, most notably in Indonesia. This calls for a more vigorous push by several key ASEAN countries,"" said Lockman. Moreover, the China-proposed ""Belt and Road"" initiative has grabbed the attention of ASEAN leaders, among whom seven ASEAN leaders or heads of state will attend the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing next month. Oh Ei Sun, a senior fellow with S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, said ASEAN should serve as a super transit point for the advancement of ""Belt and Road"" considering its geographical location and its diversity in culture and races. ""ASEAN can also become an example to let the world see how to better strengthen bilateral ties with China,"" said Oh. As for the disunity criticism leveled at ASEAN, Oh said that is exactly the strength of ASEAN, which with its resiliency knows when to accommodate differences and when to push for consensus.

As ASEAN turns 50 this year, the world seems to turn away from globalization as seen in Brexit and the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, what should ASEAN do next? Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, which chairs the ASEAN summit in Manila this year, earlier laid out several areas as priorities to be discussed with ASEAN leaders, which include peace and stability in the region, maritime security and cooperation, and ASEAN as a model of regionalism and a global player. But to build ASEAN into a model of regionalism still faces uncertainties. ""The agenda for the ASEAN community this year is unfortunately stale,"" said Shahriman Lockman, a senior analyst with the Institute of Strategic and International Studies based in Kuala Lumpur. ""Most of the easiest measures -- the so-called 'low-hanging fruits' -- have already been adopted,"" he said. On top of the most difficult issues left for ASEAN to tackle are non-tariff barriers (NTBs) and non-tariff measures (NTMs), which hinder trade despite the general slashing of tariffs in recent decades. According to the study of Lockman, the number of NTBs and NTMs have in fact increased from 1,639 measures in 2000 to 5,975 in 2015. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, when attending a forum on the sideline of the summit in Manila on Friday, said for ASEAN's economy to achieve the 9.2-trillion-U.S.-dollar figure by 2050, there has to be a 20 percent reduction in fixed trade costs. From the global perspective, ASEAN is faced with the alternative as to whether to embrace globalization, or as some have suggested to take cue from Brexit and adopt a wait-and-see stance. Abdul Majid Ahmad Khan, former Malaysian ambassador to China, said one major task for the 10 ASEAN leaders at the summit is to discuss how to deal with Trump, who since his campaign to election, has been sending a signal to turn away from globalization and to abandon multilateralism to focus on unilateralism or bilateral negotiations. ASEAN, from the start, has been a multilateralism-based organization, said Majid, adding ASEAN countries have shown some concerns for the rise of protectionism and globalization backlash. Joey Concepcion, a business advisor to Duterte, said Trump's plan to bring back jobs is at the expense of consumers' benefits. After the United States announced its formal withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), ASEAN countries, among which four countries - Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam - are also TPP participants are the first to call for the promotion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). It is believed that ASEAN would like to conclude negotiations of RCEP in 2017 to coincide with its 50th anniversary, but still, some analysts urged for cautious optimism. ""There's also been a growth in protectionist sentiments in several ASEAN countries, most notably in Indonesia. This calls for a more vigorous push by several key ASEAN countries,"" said Lockman. Moreover, the China-proposed ""Belt and Road"" initiative has grabbed the attention of ASEAN leaders, among whom seven ASEAN leaders or heads of state will attend the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing next month. Oh Ei Sun, a senior fellow with S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, said ASEAN should serve as a super transit point for the advancement of ""Belt and Road"" considering its geographical location and its diversity in culture and races. ""ASEAN can also become an example to let the world see how to better strengthen bilateral ties with China,"" said Oh. As for the disunity criticism leveled at ASEAN, Oh said that is exactly the strength of ASEAN, which with its resiliency knows when to accommodate differences and when to push for consensus. ""Such a resilient combination will help make ASEAN lead a long life -- now it's 50 years old. I believe we will see its next 50 years,"" he said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Australia's Trade Minister Steve Ciobo said securing an FTA with the Hong Kong economy would ""strengthen the trading partnership"" with one of Australia's ""most significant"" trading partners. Australia already has a zero tariff agreement with Hong Kong, however, the FTA would be aimed at securing easier access for ""services exports"" and ensure Hong Kong would remain open for Australian business. Under the proposed deal, Australian businesses would be allowed to operate within the mega economy without establishing 'on-the-ground' operations within Hong Kong. ""With Asia's emerging middle class projected to grow from 600 million today to 3 billion by 2035, the potential for services exports is significant,"" Ciobo said Monday. ""Hong Kong is an important trade and investment partner for Australia, in its own right and as a global hub for the movement of capital and goods between the mainland and the rest of the world."" ""An FTA with Hong Kong would complement our FTA with China and further integrate the Australian economy with Asia."" The trade minister said that Hong Kong has already been one of Australia's largest trading partners, and securing an FTA would ensure that Australia's relationship with the mega economy would remain strong. ""Hong Kong is Australia's leading business base in East Asia. More than 600 Australian businesses have a major presence there,"" Ciobo said. ""(The Hong Kong economy) was Australia's eighth largest export market, worth 8.31 billion U.S. dollars last financial year. Overall it was Australia's 12th largest trading partner, with total two-way trade in goods and services worth 11.56 billion U.S. dollars."" ""The (Australian government will continue to pursue) an ambitious trade agenda and more trade agreements to create more export opportunities for Australian businesses. More exports will create more Australian jobs."" Ciobo said the government will this week ask businesses and members of the public to put forward submissions in relation to a free trade agreement proposal. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The MOC launched investigations in April 2016 after receiving complaints from domestic companies, and then announced provisional measures in a preliminary ruling nine months later.

The farms in Tauranga grow vast stretches of a nutrient-rich fruit with soft, green flesh and a unique taste. It is kiwifruit, a signature farm produce of New Zealand. The fruits will later go to the table of thousands of families after being sent to Zespri for sorting and packing. Despite the name, kiwifruit is not native to New Zealand, but originally comes from China. Seeds were brought across the Pacific to New Zealand in the early 20th century by Isabel Fraser, principal of Wanganui Girls' College, who had been visiting missionary schools in China. They were planted by a local nurseryman and the vines first fruited in 1910. People thought the fruit had a gooseberry flavor and began to call it the ""Chinese gooseberry."" The gooseberry's rebranding didn't happen until New Zealand's importer began to promote the market demand of the fruit in the 1950s. It decided to name the fuzzy, brown fruit after the country's furry, brown, flightless national bird. The erstwhile Chinese gooseberry finds its root a hemisphere away in China and the earliest record of the fruit can be traced back to 2,800 years ago. The description of the fruit appeared in Shijing, or the Book of Odes, the oldest existing collection of Chinese poetry dating from the 11th to 7th centuries BC. Its original name in Chinese, mihoutao -- ""macaque fruit"" -- refers to the monkey's love for it, according to the 16th century Chinese medicine encyclopedia, the Compendium of Materia Medica. New Zealand's kiwi exports account for one third of the fruit's global supply. In 2017, China will exceed Japan as the biggest export destination of New Zealand's kiwifruit, said Holly Brown, head of Corporate Affairs for Zespri China. OPPORTUNITIES IN CHINA Zespri, the sole authorized exporter and marketer for New Zealand kiwifruit, has been gradually recognized by Chinese middle class families. Sales to China now hit 80,000 tons, accounting for 18 percent of Zespri's global sales. In 1999, its sales to China only accounted for 2 percent. The lowering of tariffs is one of the major reason why exports to China have increased remarkably in recent years. In April 2008, China and New Zealand signed the Free Trade Agreement(FTA), the first FTA China signed with a developed country. According to the agreement, all goods exported from China to New Zealand became tariff free on Jan. 1, 2016, while tariff on most New Zealand exports to China will be eliminated before Jan. 1, 2019. The FTA has created mutually beneficial concessions in the trade of goods, services and investment, including lowering tariffs for fruits. For example, on kiwifruit, China started to gradually lower its 20 percent tariff since 2008 at a rate of about 2 percent each year, before it became tariff free in 2016. Ultimately, it's the consumers, farmers and companies of the two countries that benefit from the FTA. ""Located in different hemispheres, New Zealand and China harvest kiwis at opposite seasons. The quality and supply of New Zealand kiwis are stable. They taste delicious, thus are quite popular with customers,"" a fresh product manager in Beijing Hualian supermarket told Xinhua. DEEPENED COOPERATION According to statistics from the fresh products department of Jingdong, a leading e-commerce operator in China, Zespri's kiwis are especially favored in China by middle class families in big cities, women and mothers. At Jingdong's online shopping platform, grown-in-China kiwis, mostly from the northwest province of Shaanxi, are sold just as well as Zespri's. However, instead of being rivals, Chinese and New Zealand's kiwis are complementary to each other, said Holly Brown, head of corporate affairs for Zespri China. Zespri is currently in a three-year agreement with kiwi orchards in Shaanxi to develop better kiwi breeds; it's a long-term strategy to satisfy the expanding Chinese market, Brown told Xinhua. ""Though China ranks the first in kiwi production in the world and has an abundant variety of kiwi breeds, it still lags behind in cultivation, management, transportation and branding, which calls for strengthened cooperation between China and New Zealand,"" said Zhang Lusheng, an associate professor on plant protection at China Agricultural University. ""It is important to study wild kiwi together with Chinese researchers,"" said Mirco Montefiori, leader of a New Zealand-China joint laboratory on kiwis. ""China has an inexhaustible diversity of kiwis."" Inaugurated by Chinese President Xi Jinping and then New Zealand Prime Minister John Key in November 2014, the kiwi laboratory has carried out important research on kiwi plant disease and pests, orchard management and new breed cultivation. China has been New Zealand's largest export market and import source for years, with an upgrade of their FTA under way to further release bilateral economic and trade potential. The sweet and juicy kiwis flourishing in China and New Zealand are a testament to more than a century of agricultural, technological and trade ties between the two countries. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

(Xinhua/Li Xueren) China and Australia on Friday inked a series of bilateral agreements and moved to expand free trade between the two major Asia-Pacific economies in a vote of confidence for regional cooperation in the face of rising protectionism. Visiting Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and his Australian counterpart, Malcolm Turnbull in Canberra witnessed the signing of a number of cooperation documents in such fields as the economy and trade, innovation, agriculture, food, intellectual property, security of law enforcement, tourism and education. The two countries also started negotiations to further expand the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA) to other fields, especially services and investment, Li told the Australia-China Economic and Trade Cooperation Forum in Sydney. In the new global reality that seems to be tilting towards protectionism and anti-globalization, China and Australia offer a perfect example of how free trade does not lead to tit-for-tat combat, but generates gains for both. Australia, a country abundant in natural resources, needs globalization for international trade, while the world's biggest trader China needs an open market. As Australia's biggest trading partner for the past 8 years, China has been a loyal buyer of everything from iron ore to milk powder and a passionate salesman of everything the country makes. Australia has become China's eighth largest trading partner. China-Australia bilateral trade reached 104 billion U.S. Dollars in 2016, expanding at least 1,500-fold since the two forged diplomatic relations in 1972. ""Those solid facts tell the world they need each other,"" said Liu Qing, head of the Asia-Pacific department at the China Institute of International Studies (CIIS). No doubt protectionism is going to win applause somewhere somehow, said Liu, but it would not change the prospects between China and Australia. The two have highly complementary economies and development strategies, said Liu, referring to China's Belt and Road Initiative and Australia's development plan in its north. In an article on The Australian newspaper on Thursday, Li said, ""Advance is a key word in both the Chinese and Australian national anthems."" He believed that the two countries will counter global instability through steady development and co-operation. China and Australia have a long history of cooperation. The two countries sign the ChAFTA in 2015, which immediately brought down tariffs for Australian beef, wine, fruits and other products to have easier access to the Chinese market. In the wine industry, before ChAFTA, China was Australia's second-largest market, worth about 320 million U.S. dollars in 2015-2016. Australian wine was subject to a 14-percent tariff before it hit Chinese shelves. Now about a year later, with the tariff reduced to 5.6 percent, China has become Australia's largest market for wine, now worth almost 375 million U.S. dollars annually. According to the ChAFTA, a third round of tariff cuts took place in January. When the agreement is fully implemented, 96 percent of Australian goods will be duty free, so are 100 percent of Chinese exports to Australia. China and Australia do not always see eye to eye -- anti-dumping probes come and go -- and the ChAFTA process was full of twists and turns. But the fact that they have overcome various hurdles and reached the present stage demonstrates that they have both the will and the wisdom to chart a win-win course. ""This is a bilateral relationship that has been overwhelmingly good for both countries,"" said James Laurenceson, deputy director of the Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney. ""You don't trade because one person wins and one person loses. That's the beauty of economics; whether it's trade or investment, it's a positive sum game,"" said Laurenceson. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

For the first time in four years, he was able to invest in a new yard and shed for the farm thanks to the increased revenue brought by the free trade agreement Australia has signed with China. In his farm of 810 hectares, Wright keeps 2,200 sheep for wool. Of the 10,000 to 12,000 kg of wool produced every year, 75 percent will go to China. For the 200 beef cattle at the farm, he got a better price as a result of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA), signed by the two countries in June 2015. Ratified by the legislative bodies of the two countries, ChAFTA went into effect on Dec. 20, 2015, immediately bringing down tariffs for Australian beef, wine, fruits and other products to enable them easier access to the Chinese market. Wright told Xinhua that ChAFTA eliminated the quota for Australian wool to be exported to China. The volume of wool production in his farm in 2016 increased more than 50 percent compared to that of a year ago. Before ChAFTA, China already provided virtually duty-free access for wool, under a large World Trade Organization (WTO) tariff rate quota of 287,000 tons. Under ChAFTA, in addition to the existing WTO quota, Australia received an exclusive duty-free Country Specific Quota of 30,000 tons of clean wool from Jan. 1, 2016. This volume will grow by 5 percent each year to 44,324 tons of clean wool by 2024, all at duty-free rates. This is the best outcome China has provided in any of its FTAs to date. Wright has used the increased revenue from more wool and beef sales to build the new yard and shed, and provide better veterinary treatment for the cattle. With new machinery and more fertilizer, he is optimistic he will have an even better year ahead. His son harbors the ambition to begin planting grape vines on the farm, aiming to export wine in a few years to the Chinese market. The wine industry is another of ChAFTA's success stories. Before ChAFTA, China was Australia's second-largest export market for wine, worth 415 million Australian dollars (about 320 million U.S. dollars) in 2015 to 2016. Australian wine was subject to a 14-percent tariff before it hit Chinese shelves. Now just a year later, with the tariff reduced to 5.6 percent, China has already become Australia's largest export market for wine, with the export industry now worth almost 375 million U.S. dollars annually. ChAFTA also gives Australian wine makers a significant edge in the competition against fellow wine exporters from the Old World. Tony Battaglene from the Winemakers' Federation said as the tariff rate continues to decrease before hitting zero by 2019, Australian winemakers and exporters can get a real leg up on the competition. ""We've got around 24 percent, 25 percent of their (Chinese) market ahead of France. We're now beating the Old World at their game so that's a really good outcome for us,"" Battaglene said in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) interview. There are many similar success stories. In a statement on March 17, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said: ""China is our largest trading partner, with two-way trade of 150 billion AU dollars (about 116 billion U.S. dollars) in 2016. ChAFTA ""has greatly strengthened trade and investment between our two countries, driving growth and job creation. We continue to see record bilateral investment, education exchanges and a booming tourism sector with close to 2 million journeys between our two countries in 2016,"" said Turnbull. While the previous model of China-Australia economic cooperation can be called a mining boom, now it is more appropriate to speak of a free trade boom. New opportunities have been created in the fields of agriculture, services, innovation and investment, among others. As both countries are in the midst of an economic transition, ChAFTA opens new windows of opportunity for both China and Australia. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

It is increasingly clear that the landmark deal has facilitated bilateral trade and helped underpin bilateral relations. After entering into force on Dec. 20, 2015, more than 85 percent of Australia's goods exports to China (by value in 2015) now enter duty free or at preferential rates thanks to the agreement, and that percentage is expected to continue to rise in the coming years. Although the value of Australia's exports has declined due to global pressures on key commodities over the past two years, services exports have surged 20 percent. Currently, Australia's education sector ranks third, while tourism exports rank fifth for a combined 26.14-U.S.-billion revenue boon. In the first three quarters of 2016, as tariffs were cut, the value of Australian exports to China at least doubled for products including fresh cherries, fresh and chilled abalone, and unwrought zinc, according to Steven Ciobo, Australia's minister for trade and investment. Over the same period, export values of fresh table grapes jumped six-fold to 102 million U.S. dollars, exports of medicaments for therapeutic use grew more than 90 percent to 523 million dollars, according to him. Milk powder exports grew almost 80 percent to 127 million dollars, bottled wine exports grew more than 40 percent to 309 million dollars, fresh navel orange exports grew 55 percent to 51 million dollars, and fresh cheese exports grew 28 percent to 33 million dollars, Ciobo said. With the third round of tariff cuts under ChAFTA in place since January 2017, premium Australian products like bottled wine, various pharmaceuticals, nuts, ice cream and seafood face a tariff less than half that paid by major competitors like France, the United States and Canada, he added. For the Chinese part, China's exports to Australia have grown by 7.9 percent between the 2014/15 and the 2015/16 Australian financial years to account for 18.4 percent of all imported goods, far ahead of second-placed Japan at 13.6 percent, James Laurenceson, deputy director and professor of economics with Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology, Sydney, told Xinhua. China's outbound direct investment (ODI) into Australia surged 56.1 percent year-on-year to 3.68 billion U.S. dollars in 2016, exceeding the growth rate of the country's overall ODI, according to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. A number of Chinese airlines increased direct flights between different Chinese locations and Australian cities, and the number of Chinese tourists to Australia exceeded 1.3 million in 2016, up 17.9 percent year-on-year."

Photo: Chen Lidan US President Donald Trump's failure to send his Lunar New Year greeting to the Chinese community has triggered heated discussion among the public about what it means for the Sino-US relations, even though his daughter Ivanka Trump made a surprise appearance at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC for the Chinese New Year celebrations on Wednesday. Former US presidents like Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all delivered Lunar New Year greetings to Asians who celebrate this festival. Some Chinese Net users felt Trump was being disrespectful by not sending a greeting. An Gang, a member of the academic committee of the Pangoal Institute, a Beijing-based think tank, said, ""At this moment, Donald Trump is shaping and reinforcing his tough image on immigrant issue, so he doesn't want to send the wrong signal by delivering New Year greetings to the Chinese."" On the other hand, Ivanka on Thursday posted video footage of her daughter singing a Chinese song on Twitter with the hashtag #ChineseNewYear. ""Wishing everyone an amazing year to come during these days of celebration,"" she wrote, followed by a greeting of ""Happy New Year"" spelled out in Chinese. On Wednesday, Ivanka, together with her 5-year-old daughter Arabella, who has been learning Chinese, went to the Chinese embassy in Washington, DC. Ivanka and Arabella were attracted by paper cuttings and sugar sculptures at an exhibition of traditional Chinese art and appreciated the traditional musical performance by Chinese musicians, the Xinhua News Agency reported. Chinese Net users welcomed Ivanka's visit to the Chinese Embassy. One Net user wrote on Weibo, ""She [Ivanka] is wiser and more sensible than her father."" Another said, ""Her father made a mistake, and now she is trying to fix it."" ""Diplomatically, Donald Trump doesn't want to be friendly to China, but his family may want to maintain business ties,"" read a comment from guancha.cn, a Chinese news website. ""Donald Trump wants to maintain his tough image to show his supporters that he will not change his attitude toward China, but his daughter can be more flexible,"" said Jin Canrong, associate dean of the Department of International Studies at the Renmin University of China. ""Although Ivanka can't officially represent the US government, this activity is unusual,"" Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for US Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Thursday. ""In the past, US president's New Year greetings were normally addressed to Chinese Americans because they can vote for them, but Ivanka's appearance at the Chinese Embassy amounts to a direct greeting to China,"" Xin said. Trump's views on China expressed during his campaign and his transition period were mostly provocative and offensive. He vowed to slap a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods and spoke of using the one-China policy as leverage to bargain with China on trade. 'Happy New Year to Trump' Although Donald Trump didn't say anything to the Chinese people, Chinese entrepreneurs sent greetings to him and the US people. According to the South China Morning Post on Tuesday, 100 Chinese companies have ""gone against the tide"" and seized the opportunity of Chinese New Year to express their goodwill to the new US president, who has vowed to impose steep tariffs on Chinese products. ""A large billboard sponsored by 100 Chinese companies is up and shining in New York's Times Square, wishing Trump and the US people a ""happy Chinese new year,"" the South China Morning Post reported. Meanwhile, US ambassador to China nominee Terry Branstad said Wednesday that he would play a constructive role in enhancing the China-US relationship. If China and the US, as the world's largest developing and developed countries, can improve their relationship and continue to build friendship and trade, Branstad believed it can benefit the entire world. China and the US are closely intertwined in economic and trade fields, so a trade war between the two countries will not benefit anyone, and these Chinese firms also want to deliver this message to Trump by sending greetings even if he is not very friendly to China, said Diao Daming, a research fellow at the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""So far, Trump hasn't done anything to change the interdependence between the two countries, but if he fulfills his promise of punishing China on trade, it will harm both sides by bringing more conflicts and tensions. But the question remains as to what extent China can use interdependence to bring about this change in the stance of Donald Trump remains to be seen,"" Diao stressed.

Zhuang told the Global Times as China is seeking to transform its economic model, Swiss-made products can satisfy China's increasing demand for advanced manufacturing. China is expected to learn from Switzerland on how to improve domestic industries through shifting focus from mass production to quality, she said, and ""improvement of technology is also much focused on Chinese enterprises."" The two countries are beefing up efforts to advance economic and trade ties to a new stage through a combination of China's large market and increasing demands on industrial upgrading with the technological and innovative advantages of Switzerland, noted Liu Jianying, an associate research fellow with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, a think tank under the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). Bilateral investment will expand to more sectors in the coming years including bio pharmaceutics, financial services, tourism, machinery, clocks and energy conservation, Liu said. Upgrade expected China and Switzerland have seen stable growth in trade and investment in recent years, and the Sino-Swiss FTA, which entered into force in July 2014, has provided firm support, Sun Jiwen, MOFCOM spokesperson, told a press conference on Thursday. By November 2016, accumulative investment from Swiss companies in China amounted to $6.4 billion, according to MOFCOM data. The Sino-Swiss FTA has created a positive and dynamic environment for business activities between the two countries which, in turn, has contributed to new cooperation, State Secretary Marie-Gabrielle Ineichen-Fleisch, director of the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs of Switzerland, told the Global Times. The successful establishment of a Renminbi hub in Zurich last year is just one example, she said. The FTA has improved bilateral economic and trade exchanges in general by expanding market access for goods and services for both countries, Zhuang said. But the agreement has some restricted impact because the opening-up level set in the Sino-Swiss FTA is relatively low compared to FTAs China signed with countries like Australia and South Korea, according to Zhuang. The Sino-Swiss FTA is expected to be upgraded during Xi's visit. Such measures as tariff reduction and further opening-up in the services sector are expected. Experts said that China's large consumption market has driven the sales of Swiss products and services in recent years. Products made of precious metal are the largest kind of goods Switzerland brings to the Chinese market, rising 26.3 percent year-on-year to $9.29 billion during the first nine months of last year, according to Liu. Food, beverages and tobacco from Switzerland are also exported to China in large quantities, while outbound visitors are increasingly favoring Switzerland. The number of overnight stays by Chinese tourists in Switzerland is estimated to reach 2 million by the end of 2022, according to data released by the Switzerland Tourism office on Monday var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Farok Contractor, a distinguished professor at Rutgers Business School, made the remarks in an article posted on his website Saturday. According to professor Contractor's research, adding up the numbers for exports as well as foreign direct investment (FDI) between China and the U.S., the maximum number of jobs created by such activities in China is between 17.79 and 17.99 million, while the number in the U.S. is about 1.6 million. Besides jobs, other consequences of the two nations' intertwined economy are also too important to be neglected. Many Americans blame the United States' massive trade deficit on China. However, what will happen to the U.S. consumers if the country replaces Chinese imports with U.S. manufacturing? Based on the two countries' relative economic data of 2016, Contractor calculated that U.S. consumers would pay an additional cost of 295.17 billion U.S. dollars, or 2,380 dollars per household, on consumption in 2016. Furthermore, the above estimate is only for consumer products and does not include U.S. imports of industrial output from China. Policy shifts also have unforeseen consequences and knock-on effects, such as inflation-which has been quiescent for the past decade, but could be reignited by an additional burden of 295 billion dollars. The Chinese government plowed most of their surpluses back into U.S. government Treasury bonds and securities, totaling 1.2-1.8 trillion dollars. ""It may not matter much, therefore-at least on a year-to-year basis-if the trade deficits suffered by the U.S. against China, or the rest of the world, are compensated by foreigners plowing their trade surplus money back into U.S. investments,"" said Contractor. Trump alleges that the loss of U.S. jobs is ""the greatest theft in the history of the world."" This assertion is misleading and true only in very small part. For every one U.S. job lost through international trade (1980-2016), informed analysts, such as the Wharton School, conclude that three or four jobs have been lost because of automation, robotics, information technology, and other productivity boosters. If China did not exist on the planet, other low-wage nations, such as Vietnam, India, or Bangladesh, would fill its place. Hundreds of millions are willing to work for less than one dollar per hour. Hence, the Trumpian proposal to bring jobs ""back to the US"" is feasible, but economically non-viable. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Chinese factories facing rising wages and a shortage of skilled workers (following China's one-child population policy) have themselves already taken the initiative to shut down operations in China and have relocated to Vietnam, Bangladesh, or other nations. Should a Trump administration actually carry out its threats to levy a 45 percent tariff on Chinese products, production is unlikely to return to the U.S. to any significant degree. Other nations such as India, Lesotho, and Bangladesh, will fill the breach. However, the resulting disruption of global value chains would add costs to the tune of hundreds of billions per year and increase prices for U.S. buyers by hundreds of dollars per capita. In recent years worries about Chinese investment in the U.S. are raising as the amount increases rapidly. Chinese companies invested a record 45.6 billion dollars in the U.S. economy in 2016, which are triple the amount of 2015 and a tenfold increase of annual investment just five years ago, according to Rhodium Group. Contractor believed that the Trump administration need not be greatly alarmed about this for two salient reasons. Firstly, the single biggest Chinese investments were in innocuous sectors such as real estate, hospitality, and business and financial services where proprietary technology is not an issue. Secondly, even in sensitive sectors such as computer technology and life sciences, the White House-guided Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) can, and has, embargoed foreign investment in sectors deemed sensitive or where the intelligence services or Commerce Department has indicated danger to the continued competitiveness of American firms. In fact, the cumulative or historical dollar values show that U.S. FDI value in China is at 228 billion dollars, compared with 90 to 100 billion dollars for the value of Chinese FDI investment in the U.S.. ""American firms, as far as FDI is concerned, have much more to lose in the event of a commercial dispute between the two nations,"" he said. On the Chinese front, for the past 25 years, the Chinese government has looked on the U.S. as its principal foreign market, with up to 18 million of its workers directly or indirectly involved with U.S. trade and FDI. And they have every incentive for keeping the U.S. consumer happy and the U.S. economy going strong: simply put, it is a matter of self-interest. The two great nations, which account for 40 percent of world GDP and 23 percent of the world's population, need each other, Contractor concluded. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The illustration was posted on Alibabaâs official Twitter account to explain the trade opportunities between small businesses in the U.S. and customers in China. However, the maps soon drew criticism for excluding Alaska and Hawaii on the U.S. side, and Taiwan and the South China Sea islands on the Chinese side. âWe apologize for making this rookie mistake,â stated the group on its official Sina Weibo. âWe offer no excuse for this mistake, but will make an immediate rectification. We hereby offer our deepest apologies.â The same day, the original illustration was replaced by a new and corrected version. Ma met with Trump in New York on Jan. 9 to discuss how Alibaba, as an e-commerce giant, can create more jobs by helping U.S. businesses to sell products to China. This was the first meeting between the U.S. president-elect and a high-profile Chinese businessperson.

The Chinese billionaire reportedly held a meeting with Trump in New York on Monday to discuss how the Chinese e-commerce giant could create jobs by allowing US businesses to sell products in the Chinese market. This was the first meeting of the US president-elect with a high profile businessman from China, following a barrage of tough rhetoric and actions, including threats to impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods and selection of China critics for trade positions. Though details of the meeting as to what was specifically discussed remain sketchy, it is a positive signal for China-US trade relations under Trump, following the recent turbulence, according to Bai Ming, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation. ""This is a sign that Trump is leaving the door open for pragmatic cooperation with Chinese firms, which he thinks could help the US economy and create jobs,"" Bai told the Global Times. Bai said Trump's tough rhetoric on China was meant for voters and might have been aimed at gaining some leverage in future trade negotiations with China, but ""he is a businessman and if he sees an opportunity that could benefit the US economy, he would take it."" And for Alibaba, as it looks to expand its business in the US, Monday's meeting was a positive step for the company to ""pave the way"" for its business plans under a Trump administration, according to Mei Xinyu, an associate researcher with the Ministry of Commerce. ""Alibaba is based in China, but has a worldwide platform; the company has to handle its relations with the US government well, because it's a very important market for the Chinese tech firm,"" Mei told the Global Times on Monday. It is important that Alibaba strikes a balance between expanding overseas and strengthening its base in China, Mei noted. Bai said the meeting also offers a pattern that other Chinese companies can follow in expanding to the US under Trump. ""They have to stress how many jobs you can create in the US in talking with Trump,"" he said. Ma might have picked up some tips from Masayoshi Son of Japan's Softbank Group, a major stakeholder of Alibaba, in dealing with Trump, according to Bai. Son met with Trump in early December last year and announced a $50 billion investment in the US that aims to create 50,000 jobs. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

China is the nation's largest export market for wine, with the export side of the industry now worth almost 375 million U.S. dollars annually, however, with the further tariff reductions, China's middle class will be able to access more wines at a cheaper price, something exporters hope will contribute to a bigger bottom line. Since Chinese wine connoisseurs first developed a taste for premium Australian wine, growth in the wine export business has steadied, but with the tariffs falling to just 5.6 percent from this week, exporter Kandy Xu expects the growth rate to jump yet again. ""In the beginning we exported about two containers per year, but now from last year we export 15 containers,"" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on Friday. Before ChAFTA, Australian wine was subject to a 14 percent tariff before it hit Chinese shelves, however the Winemakers' Federation's Tony Battaglene said as the tariff rate continues to reduce before hitting zero by 2019, Australian winemakers and exporters can get a real leg up over the competition. ""China's now our biggest market, so this is a great chance to increase our profits,"" Battaglene told the ABC. ""We've got around 24 percent, 25 percent of their market ahead of France.

Trade disputes have also grown politicized, with extreme trade remedies and high tariffs, according to Sun Jiwen, a spokesperson for MOFCOM. Many countries and regions have put restrictions on Chinese products such as photovoltaic panels, ceramic tiles and tires, Sun said, adding that China hopes other countries apply these trade remedies cautiously. According to Sun, a new round of tariff cuts will be enforced in 2017, following the establishment of China's free trade agreement(FTA) with Australia. According to the agreement, Australia will slash taxes on imported Chinese products including textiles, auto parts and steel, and China will lower tariffs on Australian imports such as beef, mutton, seafood, dairy, fruit and wine. China will step up construction of a cross-border e-commerce pilot zone, foster domestic free trade zones and encourage foreign investment in high-end, smart and green manufacturing, Sun said.

File Photo: CFP Private-owned Sichuan Dawn Precision Technology Co Ltd recently scored a victory against US anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations, setting a good example for Chinese companies that may need to handle possible trade disputes under the upcoming Trump presidency. After US mechanical and power transmission equipment manufacturer TB Wood's Inc filed a complaint with the US International Trade Commission (USITC) to probe certain iron mechanical transfer drive components imported from China on October 28, 2015, Sichuan Dawn spent more than 386 days responding to the investigation, which could be a lesson for Chinese exporters that face similar trade disputes, Xie Longde, the company's vice president and the board secretary, told the Global Times on Wednesday. The company, which has an annual production capacity of 20 tons of mechanical components such as sheaves and flywheels, exports to 40 countries and regions every year. The machinery firm has recorded annual revenues of 500 million yuan ($72 million) during the last two years, but faced $284 million in duties levied by the US authority. ""Also, a single trade dispute case has an impact on the whole industry. As mandatory respondent, our company has been facing huge pressure since [the USITC] launched the probe,"" he noted. From November 2015 to October 2016, the company received more than 500 pages of documents, and ""every time we responded to their questionnaires, we took them very cautiously, and even set up a special group to deal with the case,"" Xie added. On November 16, 2016, six USITC commissioners voted against issuing anti-dumping or countervailing duties as a result of the probe. ""While some of the charges were against individual companies, most were against whole industries. In both cases, responding to charges, even if it is by only a few companies in the industry, would likely retain some of the market share or result in slashed tariff rates,"" said Tu Xinquan, deputy dean at the China Institute for WTO Studies at the Beijing-based University of International Business and Economics. Industry associations can play important roles in responding to these charges, such as organizing response efforts and sharing the costs, he said, adding that collaboration and coordination among industry players is equally important. Tu also noted that there are shortcomings in regards to Chinese industry associations as many of them were born out of former government institutions and are somewhat less responsive to the needs of companies, compared with their foreign counterparts. ""Actively facing challenges, actively responding to charges, using laws and regulations as weapons, and protecting the rightful interests of enterprises through every way and mean is how all Chinese companies should be eyeing overseas markets,"" Li Xinchuang, president of the China Metallurgical Industry Planning and Research Institute, told the Global Times Wednesday. Future challenges On Tuesday, US President-elect Donald Trumpnamed Robert Lighthizer as his chief trade negotiator, according to Reuters. Lighthizer was formerly part of the Reagan administration and has legally represented US steelmakers in anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases for three decades. Lighthizer has been a harsh critic of China's trade practices, the Reuters report noted. Tu warned that there is a spillover effect in these investigations. ""When the US does it, Chinese exports that were originally headed to the US divert to other markets, which causes other countries to also start investigations against Chinese exports. ""No country is having a good time under the current world economic situation,"" Tu said, predicting that there will be more trade friction in 2017. Chinese companies have to hone their ability to predict possible trade disputes, and ready concerns over intelligent property rights, product standards and modern management systems in advance, not only for those that already have business overseas but also firms that are mulling on investing in foreign markets, according to Xie. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Its growth is no longer export-driven but led primarily by domestic consumption, which accounted for 66.4 percent of its GDP growth in 2015, according to Ministry of Commerce data.

Yu Jianlong, secretary-general of the China Chamber of International Commerce, said Trump is unlikely to have a major impact on China-US trade, much less on China's overall strength. The US has taken repeated protectionist measures against China in the past 15 years, he said, but bilateral trade has ""by and large"" fared wellï¼thanks to the long value chain of Chinese industry and the capability of the world's second-largest economy to provide for the various needs of the US market.

French cosmetics manufacturer L'Oreal has been a witness to the country's economic transformation from a centrally-planned to a free market economy in the past 15 years as China became a WTO member. ""In the next 15 years, L'Oreal will strive to tap deeper into China's huge market to let every Chinese woman have a lipstick,"" said Stephane Rinderknech, L'Oreal China CEO. Rinderknech said the company has benefitted as China's economy opened up, and the country slashed its import tariffs. The company acquired two Chinese cosmetic firms in 2014, a Shenzhen-based firm producing local skincare brand ""Mininurse"" and Magic Holdings International, a Hong Kong-listed Chinese facial care company. Rinderknech said that since entering China in 1997, L'Oreal has witnessed rapid growth. China surpassed France to become the second largest market for the brand in 2015. China has been a favored destination for foreign investment since entering the WTO 15 years ago. In 2015, foreign capital in China reached 126.3 billion U.S. dollars, 2.7 times greater than 2001. During the first ten months of this year, foreign capital reached 666.3 billion yuan in China, year-on-year growth of 4.2 percent, amid a sluggish global economy. Alongside attracting foreign money, China's WTO entry has also helped Chinese products go global. Mei Xinyu, a researcher with the Ministry of Commerce, said that China's cargo trade export volume was 266.2 billion U.S. dollars in 2001, accounting for 4.3 percent of the global volume. While in 2015, the figure exceeded 2.27 trillion U.S. dollars, accounting for 13.8 percent of the global volume. Mei said that China has fully stood by its WTO commitments in such terms as tariff-reduction and the opening of the service trade sector. China has lowered its tariff from 15.3 percent to 9.8 percent. The Newland Group based in eastern China's Fuzhou, capital of Fujian Province, is an export-oriented firm founded in 1994. Xu Han, manager of international business department of Newland's computer subsidiary, said the company started by doing processing trade for German-made chips in the 1990s. In 2001 the business earned the company 8 million U.S. dollars, making the company an important exporter in Fujian.""As an IT exporter, Newland used to enjoy the country's support policies, including export subsidies in the form of a tax rebate. However, five years after the country entered the WTO, the government called off the protection measures to push domestic firms and confront global market competition,"" Xu said. In 2001, China granted zero tariffs to imports of IT parts such as computer chips. This has benefitted both foreign producers and Chinese firms like Newland. ""About 30 percent of components in our electronic products depended on the imports of foreign products. The zero-tariff lowered our production cost,"" Xu said. He said Chinese firms today are fully aware that ""no towering trees can grow in a greenhouse environment."" ""China's experience tells the world that trade protection only creates a greenhouse in which people cannot learn to adjust their clothes as the temperature changes,"" Xu said. From assembling and processing products for foreign companies to developing its own products, Newland has become China's leading exporter of POS machines, and is the third largest POS machine supplier in Europe. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The following day U.S. President Bill Clinton said, âThe China-WTO agreement is good for the United States, itâs good for China, itâs good for the world economy.â In Summary of U.S.-China Bilateral WTO Agreement, November 16, 1999, the U.S. made clear a very important point: âThe U.S. and China have agreed that we will be able to maintain our current antidumping methodology (treating China as a non-market economy) in future anti-dumping cases without risk of legal challenge. This provision will remain in force for 15 years after Chinaâs accession to the WTO.â Fifteen years have passed and the West must âplay by the rulesâ and end its surrogate country system or risk damaging the world trading system. If the West violates Chinaâs legal rights, it risks sapping the credibility and legitimacy of the world trading system. International institutions work only if member countries believe they work. China became a member of the WTO on December 11, 2001, and the world has benefited greatly from Chinaâs reforms and will continue to benefit from future reforms. But China also has legal rights that should be upheld by all WTO members. In the Accession of the Peopleâs Republic of China, Article 15(d) states: âIn any event, the provisions of subparagraph (a)(ii) shall expire 15 years after the date of accession.â The meaning of the text is clear and simple. After December 11, 2016, members are not allowed to treat China as a nonmarket economy for the purposes of calculating antidumping duties. Chinaâs Ministry of Commerce has said that members need to abide by the Article and change their antidumping methodology or China will take ânecessary measuresâ to defend its legal rights. The Western argument that ending the surrogate country system is a domestic law issue rather than an international law issue is flawed. In the U.S., the flawed argument is based on the Tariff Act of 1930. The U.S. argues that Paragraph (18)(B) of the Tariff Act of 1930 requires the Commerce Department to consider six factors in determining whether or not to treat a country as a nonmarket economy for the purposes of calculating antidumping duties. First, the paragraph does not say anything about âfor the purposes of calculating antidumping duties.â Second, the U.S. and China âagreedâ that âin any eventâ China would be âtreatedâ as a market economy after 15 years from the date of its accession. Designating China as a market economy and treating China as a market economy for the purposes of calculating antidumping duties are two separate issues and should not be mixed. To better understand Chinaâs position, Peopleâs Daily Online interviewed Mei Xinyu, a research fellow with the Research Academy under the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. Mei said it is up to the U.S. and Europe if they want to recognize China as a market economy but as signatories to the WTOâs Accession of the Peopleâs Republic of China, they are obligated to fulfill their international commitments. The U.S., Europe, and other WTO members must stop using the country surrogate system in anti-dumping investigations against Chinese exports as scheduled at the time of Chinaâs entry into the organization 15 years ago, and instead use Chinese domestic prices and costs as the basis for adjudication. The world trading system works only if members âplay by the rules.â On March 9, 2000, Former President Bill Clinton gave a speech at Johns Hopkins University on the U.S.-China Relations Act of 2000. At the speech, Clinton brought up an argument made by his opponents: China will just break its promises; we cannot trust the Chinese to abide by WTO rules and binding dispute settlements. He responded to the criticism by saying, âWell, any of you who follow these WTO matters know that China is not the only person that could be accused of not honoring the rules-making process.â He was referring to the trade war between America and Europe over bananas and beef, which tested the world trading system. Now, the world trading system is being tested again, but this time the West is being tested and China is waiting to see if the West is willing to uphold the rules. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

As a condition for being admitted to the WTO, China agreed in 2001 that other members could treat it as a ""non-market economy"" for 15 years, ending on Dec 11, Sunday. Under this status, trading partners may use a surrogate country whose economic situation is similar to China's as a reference when determining whether China is dumping in their countries. Shen Danyang, the Ministry of Commerce spokesman, said at a news conference on Friday that China opposes continued use of the system in anti-dumping investigations against China. ""Some of the WTO members have not expressed explicitly that they will observe the 15th clause in an attempt to keep using the surrogate country system. We expect them to abide by the rules,"" Shen said. The 15th clause outlines when the surrogate system is inappropriate. Analysts said China could takes measures ranging from filing petitions to retaliating in the dispute, according to analysts. Chen Xin, director of the business department of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of European Studies, said China may appeal to the WTO. ""If the WTO rules that these countries have breached the terms of the agreement, they will have to pay for the losses Chinese companies have suffered in the anti-dumping cases. Meanwhile, China may retaliate by imposing higher taxes on imports from these countries,"" Chen said. Chen said the anti-dumping cases against China in the European Union account for 2 percent of the total trading volume between the two sides. It does more harm than good if other trading sectors are hurt because of the anti-dumping cases. Mei Xinyu, a researcher at the Commerce Ministry's Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, said that even if some countries label China as a non-market economy, it won't affect China's status as a leading country in trading. ""China has grown into a major exporter to many countries even though it has been treated as a non-market economy for years. Anti-dumping cases won't have much impact on China's overall trading volume. On the other hand, protectionism will only make the local businesses even weaker in competition,"" he said. In response to the Japanese position on the issue, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Japan needs to observe its obligation and stop using the surrogate country system in anti-dumping investigations against China as of Monday. ""China has become the largest trading partner of a lot of countries,"" said Lu Kang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman. ""China's market economy status is non-deniable whether Japan recognizes it or not."" var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

According to Japanese media, the country's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has denied China's market economy status (MEP), claiming that it will continue to impose anti-dumping duties. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Dec. 8 at a Trans-Pacific Partnership meeting that dumping by Chinese state-owned enterprises violates market order. He pointed out that Chinese steel enterprises are selling their products at a very low price due to China's overcapacity, saying such behaviors have caused huge losses for steel enterprises in other parts of the world. However, Dec. 11 marks the 15th anniversary of China's entrance to the WTO. The organization should admit China's MEP based on Chinaâs WTO accession protocol. Bai Ming, an expert from the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation under the Ministry of Commerce, said in an interview that Japan violates the rules of market economy when it tries to contain China's economic and trade development through tariff increases. This behavior will not only cause new conflicts between the two countries, but will also negatively impact their already-weak mutual trust, he added. In addition, starting in 2019, Japan has decided to remove China, Brazil, Malaysia, Mexico and Thailand from its preferential tariff framework, claiming that China is not a market economy and that the latter nations violated international market rules through dumping. Some experts believe that Japan also wishes to cover its financial deficit by removing China from the framework. According to the Japanese Ministry of Finance, imports from the 50 developing countries that enjoyed preferential tariffs in 2015 reached 1.32 trillion yen, among which goods from China accounted for more than 60 percent. Japan lost 33 billion yen due to preferential tariffs, and more than 90 percent of those losses came from the five countries above. Cheng holds that removing China from the preferential tariffs framework is totally different from the denial of China's MEP. He said Japan has no advantage in the economic gamble with China and the U.S., and that Japan has to take unfair measures in order to contain China. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"
347,http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2016/1207/c90000-9151977.html,Commentary: Western countries lose more than credibility by rejecting China as market economy,"December 07, 2016","Should the U.S., Europe and Japan recognize China as a country of market economy? There is a simple and clear answer to this question. In Article 15 of the Protocol on the Accession of the People's Republic of China to the WTO, subparagraph (a) and subparagraph (b) make it clear that âin any event, the provisions of subparagraph (a) (ii) shall expire 15 years after the date of accession.â In other words, after 15 years have passed since Chinaâs accession to the WTO, which will occur on Dec. 11, 2016, other parties should accept the price and cost of Chinese industries under investigation instead of using the Surrogate Country System when it comes to anti-dumping or counter vailing cases against China. This means that WTO members should recognize China as a market economy. With their signatures on the Protocol, the U.S., Europe and Japan should fulfill their promise to the international community. The excuses raised by these countries to deny Chinaâs status as a market economy are self-contradictory. For example, the U.S. referred to the legal basis of the Tariff Act of 1930, including âthe extent to which the currency of the foreign country is convertible into the currency of other countries; the extent to which wage rates in the foreign country are determined by free bargaining between labor and management; the extent to which joint ventures or other investments by firms of other foreign countries are permitted in the foreign country; the extent of government ownership or control of the means of production; the extent of government control over the allocation of resources and over the price and output decisions of enterprises.â However, it only takes basic knowledge of the current economic situation in China to see how ridiculous these regulations are. Take the convertibility of RMB as an example. China first achieved RMB convertibility in 1996, and loosened the regulations on capital account convertibility in recent years. Otherwise, China wouldnât achieve trillions of USD in imports annually (last year the number was nearly $1.7 trillion) or hundreds of millions of outbound tourism trips each year and increasing FDI, nor would China make more and more countries include the RMB in their foreign exchange reserves. As for government regulation, Uncle Sam should first reflect on himself before pointing fingers at China. Keeping the appearance of ârule of lawâ and âsupervision,â the public sectors of the U.S. have intervened too much in the economic lives of citizens. During the eight-year governance of the Obama administration, over 27,000 laws and regulations have been passed, and each one dragged on. One healthcare bill contained over 2,700 pages, and none of the judges or lawmakers who passed the bill had read it thoroughly. Because of overregulation in the U.S., it takes a lemonade stand 65 days to pass the approval process and five weeks to get a food safety license. It only requires faith and honesty to recognize China as a market economy, but some protectionists cannot keep their word, instead focusing on their own interests. Eventually, this will cost them. Since China has become a major import market and its economic growth rate ranks first among major economies, it is important to hold on to the Chinese market. The situations in Japan and South Korea serve as a case in point: though Japan used to be the biggest source of imports to China for almost three decades, far ahead of South Korea, the latter surpassed Japan in 2013 with a per capita GDP soaring from $11,948 to $25,977 between 2000 and 2013. At the same time, Japanâs per capita GDP only increased from $37,292 to $38,634. Whatâs more, by denying Chinaâs due economic status, Western countries will lose their credibility when it comes to trade and political negotiations. If they can treat so lightly their commitments to China, the second largest economy and the second biggest power in the world, then their commitments to other countries will truly mean nothing. Though this may not happen soon, the influence will last a long time after it takes effect.

Following is the full text of the document. The Right to Development: China's Philosophy, Practice and Contribution The State Council Information Office of the People's Republic of China December 2016 First Edition 2016 Contents Preamble I. The Philosophy of the Right to Development Abreast with the Times II. The System Ensuring the People's Right to Development III. Effectively Realizing Economic Development IV. Enhancing Political Development V. Promoting Cultural Progress VI. Promoting Social Development VII. Accelerating Environment-Friendly Development VIII. Promoting Common Development Conclusion Preamble Development is a universal human theme, providing for people's basic needs and giving them hope of better life. The right to development is an inalienable human right, symbolizing dignity and honor. Only through development can we address global challenges; only through development can we protect basic civil rights of the people; only through development can we promote the progress of human society. China, with a population of over 1.3 billion, is the largest developing country in the world. Development is the top priority of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in governance and national revitalization, and the key to resolving all other problems. Based on its prevailing conditions, China adheres to the Chinese socialist path and to the philosophy that development is of paramount importance. China integrates the principle of universal application of human rights with the country's reality. While striving to enhance the people's wellbeing through development and materialize their right to development, China endeavors to achieve higher-level development by protecting their right to development. In this regard, China has made notable progress and blazed a path in protecting human rights during the development of human civilization. Since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, the CPC Central Committee with Xi Jinpingas its core has highlighted the idea of people-centered development. In the course of realizing the Two Centenary Goals [Note: The two goals are to complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects by the centenary of the CPC (founded in 1921) and to build China into a modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, and harmonious by the centenary of the People's Republic of China (founded in 1949).] and the Chinese Dream of revitalizing the Chinese nation, it has focused on safeguarding and improving people's wellbeing, advancing all social programs, and protecting people's rights to equal participation and development. The aim is to share development benefits and achieve common prosperity among all people of the country. On the 30th anniversary of the publication of the ""Declaration on the Right to Development by the United Nations,"" China, dedicated to advocating, practicing and promoting the right to development, is willing to join the international community to share its philosophy and experience in this regard and to boost sound development of global human rights. I.The Philosophy of the Right to Development Abreast with the Times Equal access to development opportunities and development benefits are the ideals of human society wherein each and every citizen can achieve well-rounded development and enjoy full right to development. The Chinese people are diligent, wise, innovative and progressive. In traditional Chinese culture, concepts such as ""moderate prosperity"" (xiao-kang), ""great harmony"" (datong), ""having ample food and clothing"" (fengyi zushi) and ""living and working in peace and contentment"" (anju leye) fully reflect the Chinese people's aspiration for and pursuit of a better, happier life. In the long course of history, the Chinese people have always striven for better and shared development opportunities, conditions and benefits. In ancient times, China was for long the world leader in agriculture, and contributed to human progress with extraordinary development achievements. Studies reveal that until the mid-19th century, China's GDPand per capita GDP were the world's highest. Before the 16th century, China contributed 173 of the world's top 300 innovations and discoveries. After the Industrial Revolution started in the 18th century, China began losing its leadership. Foreign aggression and expansion by Western colonialists completely destroyed conditions for development in China. Repeated invasions by foreign powers, particularly from the West, from 1840 to 1949, and China's corrupt ruling class and backward social system reduced China to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. There was constant warfare, an unstable society, economic depression, no security of livelihood, and extreme poverty. The Cambridge History of China: Republican China 1912-1949 describes China's situation in the first half of 20th century as follows: ""...the great majority of Chinese merely sustained and reproduced themselves at the subsistence level ... the standard of life for many fell short even of that customary level."" [Note: The Cambridge History of China (Volume 12): Republican China 1912-1949 Part I, Cambridge University Press, 1983, p. 28.] ""As a system, China's economy which was 'pre-modern' even in the mid-twentieth century ceased to be viable only after 1949..."" [Note: Ibid. p. 29.] In these 110 years, the Chinese people struggled arduously for their right to development and equal access to development opportunity. The Chinese people are fully aware of the value of development and of their right to development. The founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949 ushered in a new era for China's development. The PRC has provided full development opportunities and conditions to the people, and vast scope to realize that right. Through more than 60 years of effort, China's overall national strength has greatly increased; standards of living have achieved a historical leap from poverty to moderate prosperity; the people's right to development in economy, politics, culture, society and environment has been effectively protected. China feeds more than 20 percent of the world's population with less than 10 percent of the world's arable land. Through more than 30 years of reform and opening-up, China has lifted 700 million people out of poverty, accounting for more than 70 percent of the global reduction in poverty. China has established the world's largest social security system, and average life expectancy had grown from 35 years in 1949 to 76.34 years in 2015, ranking high among the developing countries. The level of education has soared: in 1949, more than 80 percent of the national population was illiterate, and the enrollment rate of school-age children was only 20 percent. In 2015, net enrollment rates were as follows: primary school-age children - 99.88 percent; nine-year compulsory education -- 93 percent; high school - 87 percent. The enrollment rate for higher education has reached a level approaching that of medium-developed countries. According to the ""China National Human Development Report 2016"" released by the United Nations, China's Human Development Index (HDI) in 2014 ranked 90th among 188 countries, already in the high human development group. Over the years, proceeding from reality and following the trend of the times, China has maintained the people's principal position in the country and created its own path by taking the central task of economic development and upholding the Four Cardinal Principles [Note: The Four Cardinal Principles refer to the principles of adhering to the socialist path, the people's democratic dictatorship, the leadership of the CPC, and Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the state, and the political cornerstone for the survival and development of the Party and the state.] and the policy of reform and opening-up to serve its practice of Chinese socialism, and following the philosophy of innovative, balanced, eco-friendly, open and shared development, and thus contributed to enriching and improving the concept of right to development. The rights to subsistence and development are the primary, basic human rights. Poverty is the biggest obstacle to human rights. Without the production and supply of material goods, it is difficult or even impossible to realize any other human right. Development is a means of eliminating poverty. It provides necessary conditions for realizing other human rights, and releases human potential. The right to development is incorporated into other human rights, while the latter create the conditions for people to facilitate development and realize the right to development. Safeguarding the right to development is the precondition for realizing economic, cultural, social and environmental rights, and obtaining civil and political rights. China appreciates the articulation in the UN's ""Declaration on the Right to Development"" : ""The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development, in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized."" The people hold the principal position concerning the right to development. China values the people's supremacy and regards the people as the fundamental driver of development, striving for the people, relying on the people, and sharing among the people. It takes improving popular wellbeing and well-rounded development as the starting point and ultimate goal, and fully mobilizes people's enthusiasm, initiative and creativity to participate in, contribute to and benefit from development. To build a moderately prosperous society in all respects and realize the Chinese Dream of revitalizing the Chinese nation means to provide better education, more secure employments, more satisfying income, more reliable social security, better medical services, more comfortable housing, and a better environment, so that all individuals can develop, contribute to society, and share the opportunity to pursue excellence and realize their dreams. The right to development is a unity of individual and collective human rights. China values both individual and collective human rights as well as balance and mutual promotion between the two. ""The free development of each individual is the condition for the free development of all people."" Only through individual development can a collective develop; only in a collective can individuals achieve well-rounded development. The right to development is a human right owned by each individual as well as by the country, the nation and the entire population. The right to development can be maximized only in the unity of individuals and collective. China values the articulation in UN's ""Declaration on the Right to Development"" : ""Equality of opportunity for development is a prerogative both of nations and of individuals who make up nations."" They are all entitled to participate in and share the benefits of development on an equal basis. The realization of the right to development is a historical course. There is no end either to development or to realizing the right to development. The latter is an ongoing process of improvement. China is still in the primary stage of socialism and will long remain so. The inadequacy in meeting the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people because of backward social production will remain the principal social problem. As a major developing country, China faces challenging problems and heavy tasks in development. In pursuit of more equal participation and development, China needs consistent efforts to fully realize the people's right to development. The protection of the right to development must be sustainable. Sustainable development is a prerequisite for materializing the right to development, an embodiment of intergenerational equity. Imbalanced, uncoordinated and unequal development reflects unsustainable development, as does an extensive development model. China is pursuing a sustainable approach to production, utilization and consumption of natural resources. China now follows a sustainable and resilient socio-economic development path so as to meet the needs of both present and future generations. China has a development mindset of balance and sustainability, regarding the harmonious development between humanity and nature, between economy and society, as a new means of realizing and protecting the right to development. The right to development must be enjoyed and shared by all peoples. Realizing the right to development is the responsibility of all countries and also the obligation of the international community. It requires governments of all countries to formulate development strategies and policies suited to their own realities, and it requires concerted efforts of the international community as a whole. China calls on all countries to pursue equal, open, all-round and innovative common development, promotes inclusive development, and creates conditions for all peoples to share the right to development. Global economic governance must be based on equality. It must better reflect the new world economic pattern, give an enhanced voice and representation to emerging markets and developing countries, ensure that all countries enjoy equality of rights, opportunities and rules in international economic cooperation, and ensure the right to development is shared."

Shen's remarks came after Japanese media reported that Japan will remove five countries, including China, from a preferential tariff framework due to their economic development. The other four are Malaysia, Thailand, Mexico and Brazil, and the change will take effect in fiscal 2019, the Nikkei Asian Review (NAR) reported on November 18. ""China is still the largest developing country. Although China is the world's second-largest economy, the country's per capita GDP, urban and rural regional development and its social welfare still lag far behind developed countries and regions, and the realization of China's modernization still has a long way to go,"" Shen told a press conference in Beijing on Thursday. Given the sluggish global economy as well as the weak world trade and investment situations, China and Japan should join force to deepen cooperation, which is in line with their bilateral interests, the MOFCOM spokesman said. As the two economies are complementary, China and Japan are expected to step up efforts to advance their economic and trade ties, he noted. Starting in the 1970s, Japan provided the generalized system of preferences, a form of support for developing economies, by imposing minimal to no duties on selected industrial products. Japan's reduced tariffs now apply to about 140 countries and regions, according to media reports. The NAR report said that the five countries to be taken off the list account for 30 billion yen ($272 million) of the 33 billion yen in revenue Japan loses from the tariff framework. The report did not specify during what period Japan would lose such amount of revenue. Economies are removed from the list if they are classified as high-income economies by the World Bank for three consecutive years, the report said. ""Japan adopted this system involving its trading partners as a way to raise revenue, which is not a small amount, to ease its fiscal position,""Chen Fengying, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Thursday. In recent years, Japan has felt pressure from China's economic growth, as well as from the expansion of Mexico and Brazil, which are large developing countries in Latin America, Chen said. ""Mexico has become a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, while Thailand and Malaysia are still developing countries and there is no reason to remove them from the list,"" Chen said. Removing the five countries does not violate any world trade rules as it is a voluntary form of support offered by Japan to developing countries and regions, said Tu Xinquan, deputy dean at the China Institute for WTO Studies at the Beijing-based University of International Business and Economics. Tu told the Global Times Thursday that Japan was following the lead of the EU, which scaled back preferential tariffs to China in 2015. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

""The study provides an analysis of potential economic and social benefits and costs, analyzes the various pathways towards a Free Trade Area and identifies challenges economies may face in realizing this goal,"" said Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen in an interview with Xinhua following the conclusion of the 2016 APEC Ministerial Meeting. With its 21 members accounting for around 39 percent of the world's population, 57 percent of the world's total gross domestic product (GDP), and 49 percent of world trade, APEC is a regional economic forum aiming to create greater prosperity for the region by promoting its growth and economic integration. During the 2014 APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Beijing, member economies agreed to take concrete steps toward greater regional economic integration by endorsing a roadmap for the FTAAP. A collective strategic study along with recommendations were required to be reported to the leaders by the end of 2016. ""As the first substantial step to take the FTAAP from prospect to practice, the study is a robust response to the commitment made by member leaders in Beijing to advance the process in a comprehensive and systematic manner towards the eventual realization of the FTAAP,"" Wang said, adding that it's a good start for regional economic integration. The policy recommendations made by the study report include specifying the objectives and principles, making a comprehensive working plan, and establishing a working mechanism to advocate the process toward the FTAAP, Wang said. ""The FTAAP should be a main platform for the economic integration of the Asia-Pacific with a comprehensive and high-quality free trade arrangement, while APEC should play a more active role to advocate the FTAAP under the principle of mutual benefit and wide inclusion,"" he said. ""The report recommends making a specific working plan on removing barriers for the flow of commodities, service and investment, carrying out non-tariff measures and protecting the principle of origin,"" he said. ""Member economies need to seek consensus on the most challenging areas, and to specify what kind of arrangements should be included in the FTAAP,"" he added. The report also recommends that the APEC Committee on Trade and Investment be designated as the working-level coordinator to carry out those policies toward the FTAAP, said Wang. ""The committee will be asked to make a comprehensive working plan on how to carry out the policy consensus reached in previous meetings, and to submit reports on the progress in implementing the policies to the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in 2018 and 2020,"" he said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The 24th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting will kick off in the Peruvian capital of Lima on Saturday, with the theme of ""Quality Growth and Human Development."" At the meeting, APEC member economies will seek to make decisions to facilitate trade and investment and consolidate liberalization policies. FTAAP STRATEGIC STUDY TO BE APPROVED The idea of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) was first raised during the 2006 APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam. During the 2014 APEC meeting in Beijing, APEC member economies pushed forward the process of FTAAP by sketching out a roadmap for it. Now, the Beijing consensus is becoming a reality. A collective strategic study on issues related to the realization of FTAAP has been completed and the final version of the study along with recommendations will be presented to leaders at the Lima meeting. Juan Carlos Capunay, Peru's ambassador to China, said the Asia-Pacific has become divided in current trade talks, leaving the goal of trade and investment liberalization in the region beyond hope. APEC should build a free trade area that will cover all its members and coordinate economic development in the Asia-Pacific, he noted. Julio Chan Sanchez, Peru's general coordinator of APEC affairs, said China will play a key role in facilitating FTAAP at the Lima meeting. At the 2014 APEC meeting in Beijing, he said, China played an essential role in furthering the goal of creating a free trade zone in the Asia-Pacific. ""China's economy is progressively larger, more important and more relevant for the rest of the world, for international trade and for the global economic system,"" he said. ""China is going to have an important role, and is going to continue to have an increasingly important role."" Echoing Chan Sanchez, Raul Salazar, APEC affairs director at the Peruvian Foreign Ministry, said the upcoming APEC meeting may well approve the strategic study for FTAAP. ""We have the obligation to continue our central topic, which is the approval of the collective strategic study, which was required by the roadmap established in Beijing in 2014. It is the hope that this year the leaders will approve the study as a step forward toward beginning negotiations for FTAAP,"" he said. Salazar also praised China's contribution to pushing the idea of a free trade area in the Asia-Pacific. ""This step taken in Beijing ... has forced all the members to face the reality that this is necessary for a number of reasons. Peru holds the position that we need an Asia-Pacific free trade area. It would allow for APEC's work to be deepened and would see free trade agreements proliferate,"" he said. QUALITY GROWTH, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT In the context of sluggish growth in the Asia-Pacific and the world at large, the Lima meeting has set its theme for quality growth and human development. Analysts see regional economic integration as the core agenda of the meeting, saying the theme shows an idea for inclusive development. The meeting will be a good chance to discuss sustainable development, said Peruvian Second Vice President Mercedes Araoz. ""The agenda therefore covers all topics ranging from food security, human capital, and better integration,"" she added. Ignacio Martinez Cortes, a professor of international relations at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said that the meeting will be crucial for boosting the world economy through political agreements, and that China will play a prominent role. Reducing non-tariff measures and rejecting protectionism will map the course on finance and trade for APEC member economies, he said. Another important issue will be small and medium-sized enterprises. ""I believe they can strengthen their role as new engines of the economy, if favorable conditions are created for them,"" said Cortes. The APEC region, home to around 2.8 billion people, represented 57 percent of the world's GDPand 49 percent of global trade in 2014. The quality growth of the regional economy will undoubtedly inject fresh momentum into the global economy. PROMOTING CROSS-PACIFIC CONNECTIVITY During an APEC finance ministers' meeting in Lima last month, China's Assistant Finance Minister Dai Bohua pointed out that despite its slow growth, the Asia-Pacific is still one of the most dynamic regions that have a great potential for development. Next, he said, APEC member economies should spur potential growth through the implementation of structural reforms, so as to promote inclusive growth and sustainable development. At the same time, they should boost connectivity and create a sound environment for investment, and overcome bottlenecks such as poor infrastructure and other problems thwarting economic development, he noted. Capunay said that within the framework of APEC, China and Latin American countries can continue to discuss and cooperate in such areas as trade facilitation and the establishment of FTAAP. He also voiced the hope that with the help of the Belt and Road Initiative, Peru will strengthen trade and economic cooperation with China and other Asian countries. The initiative, which comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, aspires to build a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient Silk Road routes. The Belt and Road Initiative, which has charted a course for open and inclusive development, will not only promote connectivity, but also play an important role in boosting investment, trade and industrial cooperation among countries and regions. Salazar said China has made great efforts to build a ""much stronger, more consistent and better structured relationship"" with Latin America.` ""I think the stimulus the Chinese government is carrying out is helping, such as the Trans-Oceanic Railway,"" he said. The coast-to-coast railway, one of the main cooperation projects between China and Latin America, is expected to create a corridor connecting the Pacific and the Atlantic. ""The planning is being done correctly,"" Salazar said, adding that this physical integration would catch up with other integration policies within the Asia-Pacific region. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The central parity rate of the yuan weakened 97 basis points to 6.8592 against the dollar, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trading System. It is the yuan's weakest level against the dollar in over eight years, and the longest losing streak since December 2015. The recent yuan depreciation is partly due to stronger expectations of an interest rate increase by the U.S. Federal Reserve, said Zhong Yue, analyst at Forextime Ltd., a global online foreign exchange transaction provider. Political uncertainties have eased in the United States after Donald Trump defeated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, leading to a stronger dollar and an expectation of a U.S. interest rate hike. China's economy expanded 6.9 percent in 2015, the slowest pace in a quarter of a century. Despite signs of stabilizing in recent months, the country is still having a hard time managing an increasingly overheated property market and stemming capital outflows. Trade relations with the U.S. are expected to be dreary as Trump has threatened a 45-percent tariff on imports from China. Facing uncertainty in China-U.S. trade, it is possible that China may take the opportunity to release the pressure in advance, allowing the yuan to weaken somewhat as the dollar rises, said Huili Chang, analyst at China International Capital Corp.@ Yu Yongding, economist and former central bank advisor, applauded the central bank for decreased intervention in the yuan's exchange rate, saying it will help ensure monetary policy independence. ""There is no need to fear the depreciation of the yuan. Currently, the benefits of a weaker yuan outweigh the downsides, as a weaker yuan is conducive to boosting exports and curbing capital outflows,"" Yu added. Last week, trade data showed China's exports and imports fell year on year in October due to weak domestic and global demand. China has the world's largest currency stash. It fell to 3.12 trillion dollars at the end of October, down 45.7 billion dollars from a month earlier, marking the lowest level since March 2011. However, a stronger dollar accounts for much of that change. Looking ahead, the yuan may come under short-term pressure but have limited room for further weakening. Analysts also ruled out the possibility of substantial depreciation in the longer term as China continues to witness steady economic growth, progress in economic restructuring and a stable financial market. ""There is no basis for a sustained depreciation trend for the yuan, and we maintain the forecast of 6.98 for the end of 2017,"" Chang said. Because there is enough fuel in the tank to achieve the government's target of 6.5 to 7 percent economic growth for the year, analysts also think room for further monetary easing is limited. In China's spot foreign exchange market, the yuan is allowed to rise or fall by 2 percent from the central parity rate each trading day. The central parity rate of the yuan against the dollar is based on a weighted average of prices offered by market makers before the opening of the interbank market each business day. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Despite certain challenges, opportunities can be found in this upset to improve the China-U.S. relationship, experts pointed out at a seminar held by the Center of China and Globalization (CCG) on Nov. 10 in Beijing. Trump claimed during his campaign that he would designate China as a ""currency manipulator,"" imposing a 45 percent tariff on imported Chinese goods. He has also urged opposition to TPP and globalization. Wang Huiyao, director of CCG, pointed out that Trump's campaign statements may not all be implemented, or may not be implemented fully, due to practical national and diplomatic concerns. After all, Trump is tasked with representing the will and interests of the entire nation. The main bilateral challenges therefore lie in the uncertainty of U.S. policies going forward, and the negative impact brought about by backtracking globalization. According to Wang, trade is where China and the U.S. share the most common interests. Both countries have achieved tangible benefits through bilateral cooperation in the past. As important participants in and beneficiaries of globalization, both China and the U.S. should firmly support and lead the development of globalization, promoting the inclusive growth of all countries in the world. An Gang, a senior editor and journalist at World Affairs, holds the view that Trump's promises to cut taxes for enterprises and return manufacturing jobs to the U.S. are likely to pose the most major obstacles for China-U.S. cooperation under his leadership. However, Trump also said he would improve the infrastructure of the U.S., and Chinese companies may have a chance to participate in this effort in the future, according to An. Zhou Xiaojing, former director of the Asia-Africa Development Research Institute under the Development Research Center of China's State Council, also believes that Trump's success may bring more favorable than troubling news for China-U.S. relations. However, China should still make preparations and take measures to handle pressure on the RMB exchange rate and China-U.S. trade. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Trump has pledged to scrap some multinational trade deals, and branded the 12-nation TPP, which was signed in New Zealand this year, as a ""rape"" to the United States. Key told Radio New Zealand Thursday that the deal was ""definitely not going anywhere in a hurry"" and discussions would probably be put on hold. ""It would have been nice to have, but we're not going to have it in the short term,"" said Key. ""But does that mean there will never be an attempt to re-negotiate it? No, because President Trump will get the same advice from the State Department, from the Pentagon, from the Treasury that President Obama got, which is that you need to have influence and you need to have presence in Asia and to do that free trade locking you in there is the way to do it."" The Business New Zealand lobby group said international trade could be a source of tension with Trump as U.S. President. New Zealand's prosperity relied on open and free trading of its export products, and if the U.S. took a more closed approach to trade in future, New Zealand export returns could be affected, chief executive Kirk Hope said in a statement. ""The U.S. is New Zealand's third largest export market. Trade with the U.S. earns New Zealand over 5 billion NZ dollars (3.65 billion U.S. dollars) a year in products including meat, dairy and wine, and over 2 billion NZ dollars (1.46 billion U.S. dollars) a year in services. A reduction in this level of trade would make a difference to New Zealand's growth prospects,"" said Hope. The Export New Zealand lobby group said Trump's election signalled ""a bumpy ride"" for currency markets and a lost opportunity to reduce trade barriers for New Zealand products if the TPP was knocked back. ""Trump's anti-trade position and general protectionist stance is concerning. If his intentions to stop U.S. companies from outsourcing overseas and tariff walls eventuate then New Zealand will lose from this,"" executive director Catherine Beard said. ""We hope that in reality, common sense prevails and there will be a return to a more orthodox position on international affairs."" University of Auckland law Professor Jane Kelsey, who had helped lead opposition to the TPP internationally, said the vote for Trump was a backlash against such trade deals from ordinary people who felt alienated and disempowered. President Barack Obama's administration had been ready to put the implementing legislation for the TPP to a vote during the lame duck period of Congress, Kelsey said in a statement. ""It is still possible they would try. But to do so in the face of the landslide vote for Trump, and for enough Republicans to endorse the legislation, would be hugely provocative when the talk is of healing and unity,"" she said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Others argued that the overall direction for one of the largest and most consequential bilateral trade relationships will remain unchanged, and a Trump presidency might not be as negative as many have suggested, noting that the rhetoric might help ease the pressure on yuan depreciation and capital outflows and help with ongoing efforts to upgrade China's industrial sectors. As votes were being counted in the US on Wednesday, Chinese stocks went through ups and downs during the day, seeing the largest drop of 1.6 percent at one point. But the market later regained ground and closed only slightly lower than the previous day. The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.62 percent, while the smaller Shenzhen Composite Index was down 0.61 percent. By contrast, in the US, stock market futures trading were suspended after plunging the daily limit of 5 percent. Japan's Nikkei was down about 5 percent, and Australia's S&P/ASX200 closed 1.9 percent. Trump's win also sent waves in the foreign exchange and commodities markets, with the US dollar falling 3.6 percent against the Japanese yen and climbing 11 percent against the Mexican peso. But spot trading of the yuan was up a slight 0.18 percent against the dollar. ""The Chinese markets remained calm because they are relatively independent and depend mostly on the performance of the domestic economy,"" said Xu Gao, chief economist at China Everbright Securities Co. But a Trump win could pose some unprecedented challenges to China, especially in trade negotiations, Chen Lijian, an assistant professor at the University of Dayton in Ohio, wrote in a note to the Global Times. ""China will face unprecedented challenges in terms of economic and trade ties [with the US],"" Chen wrote. Trump believes that China heavily depends on the US market, pricing for global commodities is in the hands of the US and Europe economies, and Chinese food and goods and materials supplies are also dependent on the US, Xu said. ""Trump is very slippery, he will take all measures to capitalize on such advantages,"" said Xu. Trade deals with the US would be tough to move forward, and the ongoing talks on a China-US Bilateral Investment Treaty would face tough obstacles, analysts said. ""But in the long-run, the China-US trade ties won't see substantial changes because of potential consequences on both economies,"" said Liu Xuezhi, a senior analyst at Bank of Communications. Analysts also said Trump would not be able to follow through on his ""ridiculous"" claims such as imposing a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports and stop or renegotiate all trade deals. ""If his goal is to bring jobs back to the US, his first and foremost job is not to be tough on others, but to improve the US economy and industries first,"" Xu said. Raising tariffs on Chinese goods will hurt not only the Chinese economy but also the US and others because the value chain in manufacturing is so intertwined, analysts said. In fact, Trump's rhetoric on Chinese manufacturing might become a source of motivation for domestic industries to improve efficiency and upgrade capacity, Liu said, noting the Chinese manufacturing sector is facing pressure not just from the US, but more so from other countries in Southeast Asia. ""And Trump's win might help ease pressure on the yuan exchange rate and capital outflows. Trump's tough rhetoric might end the yuan's depreciation and help stabilize the currency, and with a stable yuan, this will further relieve pressure on capital outflows, because such outflows were based on the expectation of the yuan's further devaluation,"" Xu said. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

""We meet at a time when the global economic recovery is progressing ... but downside risks remain,"" the leaders said in the Goa Declaration, noting that commodity price volatility, weak trade, high private and public debt, inequality and the lack of inclusiveness in economic growth are all challenges the global economy faces. They vowed to use ""all policy tools - monetary, fiscal, and structural - individually and collectively, to achieve the goal of strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth."" The leaders also said they will continue to strengthen cooperation through existing initiatives under the BRICS mechanism, such as the New Development Bank (NDB), while continuing to focus on initiatives on areas such as e-commerce, ""single window"" trade, intellectual property, micro, small and medium enterprises. The NDB will provide loans worth $2.5 billion next year after making its first loans to back green projects, its president KV Kamath told Reuters. He also said that the Shanghai-based bank had approved loans to develop the renewable energy sector. Zhu Jiejin, a senior researcher at the Institute of BRICS Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times that renewable energy is acceptable for every party and Western countries, and the NDB was right to choose this area as a starting point, but in future, the NDB might require some innovations. The BRICS - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - agreed to create the NDB in July 2014, with an initial capital of $100 billion. The lender was officially launched a year later. ""The fact is these countries collectively have in the last few years contributed to more than 50 percent of incremental economic wealth generated globally,"" said Kamath. ""I don't see that changing."" Areas such as non-tariff measures, the services sector, and standardization and conformity assessments are ""possible areas of future cooperation,"" the declaration said. ""And to further strengthen the global governance architecture,"" it said BRICS is exploring the possibility of setting up an independent BRICS Rating Agency based on market-oriented principles. In an address at a meeting with the BRICS Business Council, Chinese President Xi Jinping said despite slower growth rates, ""BRICS' potential and advantages in resources, market and labor has not changed, and the long-term development potential remains huge."" Xi urged the BRICS Business Council to instill confidence in the BRICS economies by consolidating the member countries' resources, push innovation in the BRICS economies to achieve sustainable growth, and to facilitate ""pragmatic cooperation"" among companies in the BRICS countries to improve competitiveness."

Both the G20 summit and the Fund-Bank meetings reiterated the concerns of the international community over the slow growth in world trade and the increasing tendency of countries to resort to protectionist measures. The 8th BRICS Summit also noted these concerns. World trade is currently growing at a rate lower than that of the growth in world economy. This has been happening for the last few years. The slowdown in world trade growth points to the lack of contribution of world trade to global economic growth. This is a disappointing development. Robust world trade enables most countries and businesses of the world to participate in the global exchange of goods and services for increasing their own incomes as well as incomes of their countries and that of the world as a whole. Slow trade growth does not enable such participation. With slow trade growth, world growth becomes dependent on economic performances of individual countries. Countries with large domestic economies â such as the US, China, India and Brazil â might be able to record good growth in spite of a slowdown in world trade. But many other economies â both developed and emerging market countries â would be unable to do so, given their dependence on world trade. As a grouping of the worldâs largest emerging market economies, BRICS needs to develop a strategy for tackling world trade slowdown. It is probably in this regard that BRICS members need to consider the possibility of a trade cooperation framework between them. The framework might assume any structure and can be loosely called a BRICS FTA. Some might argue that the BRICS FTA is likely to remain as a non-starter because of the lack of geographical contiguity. While China, Russia and India can be considered neighbors in the sense of their being the largest countries in Asiaâs continental landmass, South Africa and Brazil are farther away and in two different continents. However, modern FTAs between countries, including mega trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, are not bound by the notion of geographical contiguity. Since modern trade is much more than trade in goods, and comprises trade in services, cross-border flow of capital and movement of labor and technologies, geographical contiguity is not a necessary condition for the success of a FTA. BRICS countries already have the example of establishing the New Development Bank (NDB). The NDB reflects the ability of some of the worldâs largest emerging markets to come together to mobilize finance for addressing economic challenges that are common to all emerging markets â infrastructure and sustainable development. Thus the example of BRICS members creating a cooperative economic framework is already there. The NDB can be the springboard for further economic cooperation between BRICS members. Working towards a FTA involved many challenges. While all BRICS members are emerging markets, their economic conditions are different. These differences are most visible in their national comparative advantages. While China has great comparative advantages in export of manufacturing, Brazil, Russia and South Africa have similar advantages in several resource-intensive exports, while India has a strong comparative advantage in services. These differences might create problems between members in reaching unanimity over the elimination of import tariffs on various products. There could also be similar problems in agreeing on non-tariff barriers and regulatory standards. A more effective way of facilitating trade between BRICS nations would be to explore the possibility of them investing more in each other. BRICS members can âfast-trackâ investment proposals from other BRICS members and expedite capital flows by establishing common investment rules, both for investment protection as well as flow of funds. Many of these investments would encourage trade and exports. The flow of investments between BRICS member countries can be facilitated by the NDB through quick disbursement of finance for projects capable of yielding long-tern investment goals. It is important for BRICS countries to work together to address the problem of slowdown in global trade growth. But rather than moving immediately on a FTA, it might be better to pick-up areas of economic cooperation that can recharge trade. A BRICS framework for investment can be an effective idea.

It seems China is willing to open up its domestic markets to the other four member countries, but they haven't yet made quite the same commitment. China recently mooted the idea of setting up a free trade area among BRICS countries, with the country's Ministry of Commerce saying a free trade area would be ""a significant form of cooperation."" Beijing has shown sincerity in removing tariff and non-tariff barriers to goods produced in other BRICS countries - the question remaining is whether those nations will match the goodwill of China. Total retail sales of consumer goods in China rose by 10.6 percent year-on-year in August, underlining the rapid expansion of China's domestic consumer market. The country's rising consumer buying power has caught the eyes of many in the business elite. For instance, Bloomberg reported Monday that China's electric vehicle market is so hot that India's biggest SUV maker is angling for a piece of the action to exploit the world's biggest auto market. Multinational firms are always more sensitive to commercial opportunities in offshore markets than policymakers. The governments of India, Russia, Brazil and South Africa may have undervalued China's consumer markets. With the ""Make in India"" campaign initiated by the Modi administration, India is in urgent need of exploring foreign markets to make itself a global manufacturing hub. Additionally, Russia, Brazil and South Africa, whose economies are suffering different degrees of hardship, also need to gain momentum from cooperating with China to push for greater market integration. BRICS countries account for 40 percent of the world's population. Closer market integration among the nations will definitely help tap the potential for all BRICS members to grow their economies. Media reports said BRICS trade ministers will sign an agreement for better economic cooperation with an eye to promoting trade facilitation and reducing non-tariff barriers, but some BRICS members are not in a hurry to consider a free trade area. These countries may be overly cautious about trade liberalization, and multinational firms will be the victims of such conservative ideas. China is speeding up its effort to foster a high-standard global free trade network, and has signed 14 free trade agreements with countries and regions including Australia and South Korea. Hopefully, the other BRICS countries will not fall too far behind in terms of sharing the fast-growing domestic market in the world's second-largest economy. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

BRICS members can âfast-trackâ investment proposals from other BRICS members and expedite capital flows by establishing common investment rules, both for investment protection as well as flow of funds. Many of these investments would encourage trade and exports. The flow of investments between BRICS member countries can be facilitated by the NDB through quick disbursement of finance for projects capable of yielding long-tern investment goals. It is important for BRICS countries to work together to address the problem of slowdown in global trade growth. But rather than moving immediately on a FTA, it might be better to pick-up areas of economic cooperation that can recharge trade. A BRICS framework for investment can be an effective idea.

It seems China is willing to open up its domestic markets to the other four member countries, but they haven't yet made quite the same commitment. China recently mooted the idea of setting up a free trade area among BRICS countries, with the country's Ministry of Commerce saying a free trade area would be ""a significant form of cooperation."" Beijing has shown sincerity in removing tariff and non-tariff barriers to goods produced in other BRICS countries - the question remaining is whether those nations will match the goodwill of China. Total retail sales of consumer goods in China rose by 10.6 percent year-on-year in August, underlining the rapid expansion of China's domestic consumer market. The country's rising consumer buying power has caught the eyes of many in the business elite. For instance, Bloomberg reported Monday that China's electric vehicle market is so hot that India's biggest SUV maker is angling for a piece of the action to exploit the world's biggest auto market. Multinational firms are always more sensitive to commercial opportunities in offshore markets than policymakers. The governments of India, Russia, Brazil and South Africa may have undervalued China's consumer markets. With the ""Make in India"" campaign initiated by the Modi administration, India is in urgent need of exploring foreign markets to make itself a global manufacturing hub. Additionally, Russia, Brazil and South Africa, whose economies are suffering different degrees of hardship, also need to gain momentum from cooperating with China to push for greater market integration. BRICS countries account for 40 percent of the world's population. Closer market integration among the nations will definitely help tap the potential for all BRICS members to grow their economies. Media reports said BRICS trade ministers will sign an agreement for better economic cooperation with an eye to promoting trade facilitation and reducing non-tariff barriers, but some BRICS members are not in a hurry to consider a free trade area. These countries may be overly cautious about trade liberalization, and multinational firms will be the victims of such conservative ideas. China is speeding up its effort to foster a high-standard global free trade network, and has signed 14 free trade agreements with countries and regions including Australia and South Korea. Hopefully, the other BRICS countries will not fall too far behind in terms of sharing the fast-growing domestic market in the world's second-largest economy. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

The difficulties are not short-term problems, with uncertain and unstable factors increasing, Shen Danyang, spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, said. Foreign trade improved markedly in August, customs data showed in September, with exports and imports rising 5.9 percent and 10.8 percent respectively, the first time since November 2014 that the figures have both risen on a monthly basis. However, in the first eight months, foreign trade was down 1.8 percent from a year earlier, with exports dropping 1 percent and imports falling 2.9 percent, official customs data showed. Citing the figures, Shen said it is no time for complacency and the situations is still complicated and daunting. Increasing trade frictions concerning Chinese exports are partly to blame. From January to August, 20 countries or regions launched 85 trade remedy probes against Chinese products, up 49 percent and worth 10.3 billion U.S. dollars, almost doubled the amount for the same period last year, Shen said. In those eight months, the United Stateslaunched 15 trade probes under the Section 337 of the 1930 Tariff Act against Chinese products, he said.

Starting Thursday, China, the world's largest IT products exporter, would cut import duties on 201 IT products covered by the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), a global technology trade pact under the World Trade Organization (WTO), according to the Ministry of Finance. The products include integrated circuits, touch screens, semiconductors and medical devices. The government also promised to reduce tariffs to zero on these products within seven years. Over 50 countries, including China, reached an agreement last year at a WTO meeting in Nairobi, Kenya, to begin implementing their tariff commitments to the ITA by July 1, 2016, while the timetable is subject to the completion of each country's domestic procedural requirements. China's legislature passed a bill earlier this month to ratify an amendment to the ITA. ""The ratification and implementation of the amendment will be in the interests of China's drive to build an open economic system and to accelerate the development of domestic IT industry amid international competition and cooperation,"" said the National People's Congress Foreign Affairs Committee in a review report to the lawmakers. The move meant that China would play a bigger role in participating in global resources relocation and move upper in the global industrial value chain thanks to lower import costs, according to Bai Ming, a researcher with the think tank of the Ministry of Commerce. Global trade of the 201 IT products is valued at 1.3 trillion U.S.dollars, about ten percent of total world trade. China's foreign trade volume of the goods is about a quarter of the amount, according to Lou Jiwei, head of the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council. Based on 2014 figures, eliminating these duties will cost China 15 billion yuan (about 2.24 billion U.S. dollars) and 52 billion yuan in annual actual and potential tariff revenue losses respectively, Lou said. The adjustment of tariffs would be conducted in a gradual manner, which would not impact China's IT industry much despite expected larger imports of less expensive IT products, said Liu Yingkui, a researcher with the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. Chinese IT enterprises should harness free global trade and enhance their R&D capabilities to seek wider global reach with investment, Liu added. The Chinese government decided to raise the ratio of R&D investment on GDP from 2.1 percent in 2015 to 2.5 percent by 2020, with major breakthroughs in fundamental research and strategic technologies. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

In a letter to Congress, Obama said he intended to reinstate preferential treatment for Myanmar under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, a preferential tariff system. The move came as Obama hosted Myanmar State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi at the White House on Wednesday. The Myanmar leader is visiting the United States for the first time since her party won a sweeping victory in the general election last year. After their bilateral meeting, Obama told reporters the United States is ready to lift sanctions on Myanmar. ""The United States is now prepared to lift sanctions that we have imposed on Burma for quite some time,"" said Obama, who later added that the move would come ""soon."" ""It is the right thing to do in order to ensure that the people of Burma see rewards from a new way of doing business and a new government,"" Obama said. According to a joint statement by the United States and Myanmar, the United States will terminate the national emergency with respect to Myanmar and will revoke the executive order-based framework of the Myanmar sanctions program. The move represents Washington's recognition of ""the progress toward democratic transition that Myanmar has achieved, including through the election of a civilian-led government,"" the joint statement said. Hailing the ""remarkable"" progress Myanmar has made, Obama said Suu Kyi is in a position to ""begin shaping a remarkable social and political transformation and economic transformation"" in the country. ""We have reached a point where, as President Obama said, people did not expect us to reach five years ago, although we were quite confident that we'd get there,"" Suu Kyi said. ""But now we have to go ahead."" She also acknowledged that ""there's so much that has to be done in our country,"" adding that the most important thing is national reconciliation and peace. In May, the United States lifted some of the sanctions on Myanmar to show support for the country's political reforms and economic growth and to facilitate trade between the two sides. The move eased restrictions on Myanmar's financial institutions, allowed certain transactions related to U.S. individuals living in the country, and removed seven state-owned enterprises and three state-owned banks from the U.S. blacklist. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

Cui Pengsen / For China Daily Demand for affordable imported wine is on the rise in China and driving US exports. Jeff Williamson, director of California State Trade and Export Promotion, told China Daily at the 27th Food Expo in Hong Kong in mid-August that California's wine exports to Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland are recovering from a sluggish 2014. Chinese Customs released data that China's imported wine market made significant headway in 2015, with consumption volume of imported wine reaching 43.7 million - liter cases, a 37 percent increase over 2014. Williamson said California's exports to China kept growing in double digits from 2007 to 2013, but then plummeted by about 10 percent in 2014. Thankfully, sellers adjusted to market changes soon. He said US wine shipped to China has become more value-oriented. ""Producers are making 20-dollar bottles of wine, or even below (that price), and they are doing very well on China market."" The rise of China's middle class is driving the imported wine market. A UK-based wine research institute, Wine Intelligence, said in its latest report - China Landscapes 2016 - in July that about 48 million urban upper middle class Chinese were drinkers of imported wine last year, up from 38 million in 2014. Wines priced in the 200-300 yuan range sold the most. Williamson also found that sales of white wine are soaring. This variety has gained popularity particularly among women, he said. ""The market for wine is becoming more mature and people are becoming more knowledgeable in the China market."" Dave Yip, a Hong Kong citizen in his 30s, started to import wine to Shenzhen in Guangdong province by the end of 2014. The volume of his imports in 2015 was about 20 containers. He said drinking wine is becoming a fad among commoners. The most popular wine in his business is the one costing about 300 yuan. Williamson said online channels are boosting sales of inexpensive wines in China. He said in the last two years many companies visited California, the fourth largest wine exporter to China market, and selected products for sale on Taobao.com, Alibaba Group's online marketplace. Low-priced wines attract low import duty and other taxes, thanks to the mainland's cross-border e-commerce preferential policy, he said. So, products sold online with an import duty of less than 50 yuan are exempted from taxes, while mainland customs normally levy a 17 percent value-added tax and 14 percent tariff on imported bottles of wine. Such bottles move quickly off online shelves that are favored by young buyers, whose numbers are growing to be on a par with the mainstream in China's wine market. The China Landscapes 2016 report said approximately half of young consumers, aged from 18 to 29, buy wine online. This is having an impact on sales and marketing strategies of wine importers. So are changes in the price range of popular wines, consumption channels and the mainstream consumer segment. Zhu Hailun, a mainland wine supplier, said she will start selling imported wine this month on online wine selling platform Jiuxian.com. So far, the online outlet used to focus on Chinese white wine. Now, imported wines will retail between 200 yuan and 300 yuan. Last year, she sold about 10 containers of red wine imported from Europe and the Americas. She expects the business to increase this year, thanks to online channels and new international brand partners. var addthis_config = {""data_track_addressbar"":false};"

This is a problem that needs our attention. To change the situation, we not only need tariff reductions and good-quality domestic products, we also need the government to get involved a high level,â said Wang Jianlin, chairman of the Dalian Wanda Group. Wang made the remarks on Aug. 25 at the 10th Wanda Group Annual Commercial Convention. Wang, the richest man in China, quoted official statistics in his speech, noting that Chinese outbound travel spending amounted to 2.5 trillion yuan, even without the inclusion of expenses for medical treatments and sports. Wang pointed out three important characteristics of Chinese overseas spending: ongoing two-digit growth; overseas shopping, which includes everything from luxuries to daily articles; and emerging consumer sectors, such as overseas physical examinations and medical treatment. Wang also disclosed that one district government in Seoul, South Korea actually invited him to invest in plastic surgery hospitals for Chinese women by providing cheap land. However, Wang refused, since such an investment would push even more Chinese to consume abroad. When discussing the reasons behind overseas spending, Wang surmised that price is the most major determinant, followed by quality and brand. He insisted that there are issues in the current pricing system, caused partially by tariffs. Chinese consumers are plagued by concerns over the quality of products in China, so they prefer to buy more secure commodities in foreign countries. The popularity of e-commerce without direct contact makes the situation even worse. In addition, some consumers shopping for luxuries enjoy the feeling that they are buying something they cannot access at home. Wang proposed three measures to reduce overseas spending. First, professional studies on overseas spending are an urgent priority, such as surveys on market volume, targeted consumers and the impacts on China. Second, the government needs to regulate the market from a high level. For instance, Wang believes that companies intentionally drive up the price of luxury goods in China. Third, Wang hopes to see a media campaign for Chinese products, and for counterfeit and shoddy products to be minimized through stricter quality standards."

The minister also noted that the previous efforts of the Chinese government and private investors have made positive impacts and also have been put to the best use for the improvement of the country. Also in a message on behalf of President, as chair of the Heads of ECOWAS, Grigsby said the Beijing gathering reaffirmed the longstanding strong bond of friendship and cooperation between Africa and China based on equality and mutual respect. He added: âThe level and quality of representation today of over 300 hundred delegates including 100 of Ministerial rank bear testimony to the strength and intensity of the Africa-China relationship.â Grigsby recounted the numerous projects by Chinese investors in Africa including railways, highways and industrial plants which bring light and better livelihood to millions who otherwise would never have benefited from such amenities in their lifetimes if investment were to be determined strictly by the traditional profit motive. He stated that the underpinning Chinaâs development assistance has overwhelmed Africa and Africans, when other donors classify as risky investment Chinese assistance sees as response to real human development need. He further said, as China has increasingly become the engine of growth for the global economy, so has Chinaâs development assistance graduated from being perceived as a source of alternative development. Today, Grigsby said, China is a major donor partner, being an architect of the China/Africa Development Fund, the Asia Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB) and the BRICS Bank. Grigsby also used the occasion to commend China for its contribution to regional security and its strong and continued engagement in security cooperation with ECOWAS that has great wealth of experience in dealing with regional security including peace keeping. âTerrorism has become a serious menace to our region and indeed to the entire Continent and the world. This peril is manifesting itself on land, in the air and on the high seas. It must be confronted collectively and decisively,â he indicated.

According to him, West Africa is the most integrated region on the Continent with decades of experience in successful visa free movement of people and a common ECOWAS Passport. He mentioned regional role peacekeeping and collective security around the region is unparalleled. âWe have made impressive progress towards adopting a common eternal tariff (CET) and have developed a roadmap entitled Vision 2020 for the development of highways and railways connecting all the countries in the region; regional power grid; telecommunications and agriculture and regional industries for value addition with a market of more than 400 million people.

The ties between People's Republic of China and Africa were witnessing progress reflects the two sides determination and their serious work to carving out the mutual interests for their peoples who also contributed more and encourage the two sides to exert an efforts towards the historic relations. Chinese President Xi Jinping delivers a speech during the opening ceremony of the Johannesburg Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Johannesburg, South Africa, Dec. 4, 2015. (Xinhua/Lan Hongguang) The Chinese-African Cooperation Forum which established in 2000 in Beijing became an effective organ for the collective multiparty cooperation between China and Africa and it represents framework and important forum for equal and stable partnership based on mutual interest on the long run. China is giving due concern to the positive role played by the forum with regard to boosting political dialogue as well as realistic cooperation between china and Africa. People's Republic of China government implemented seriously the statement of the Chinese-African Cooperation Forum, which considered the backbone of enhancing the communication process in upcoming future. The ChineseâAfrican Cooperation is a basic part of South- South cooperation, explaining that the unshakeable policy of the Chinese government is based on supporting solidarity and Cooperation with the African and other developing countries. Over the past few decades, China's rapid economic growth and expanding middle class has fueled an unprecedented need for resources. The economic power house has focused on securing the long -term energy supplies needed to sustain its rapid industrialization, locking down sources of oil and other raw materials across the globe. As part of this efforts, China has turned to Africa. Through significant investment in a continent known for political and security risks, China has helped many African countries develop their nascent oil sectors in exchange for advantageous trade deals. At the same time, Beijing's complex relationship with the continent has challenged its noninterference policy in the affairs of African governments. China's rise and Africa's renaissance have gone hand in hand, creating a historic opportunity for the development of China-Africa relations. However, the international situation remains complex and competition among great powers in Africa has intensified. This brings many internal and external challenges to the China-Africa relationship. seizing opportunities, meeting challenges, and upgrading ties will continue to be major tasks, China's strategic to continue promoting South-South cooperation, and constantly enhance African governance capacities. SouthâSouth Cooperation is an important means tackling global imbalances. It is also a vital support in advancing China-Africa relations. The promotion and further development of South-South Cooperation must be based on improving the governance capabilities of African nations. In fact, the current developmental plight African societies face is this, how to choose a development path suitable for regional realities, how to achieve political and social stability in Africa, how to concentrate the superior resources of the region to participate in international competition and cooperation, and how to properly use favorable international factors to enhance Africa's own development capabilities. The keys to enhancing governance capacities in Africa are achieving peace and stability, building strong and responsible governments, and exploring an effective development path, in this regard, there is tremendous scope for cooperation between China and Africa. In fact, African people have clearly expressed their ideas on exchanging experiences with China in state governance. China actively participate in Africa's peace âbuilding, effectively securing Africa's international rights. Peace and stability in Africa are currently some of the most critical problems in the region, and also affect Africa's sustainable development. China can use its platform as UN Security Council permanent member to play a constructive role in UN peacekeeping in Africa which famous for the civil wars and complicated conflicts. In fact, China has deployed the largest number of peacekeeping forces among the permanent UN Security Council ( UNSC) members, making it an indispensable part of the African peacekeeping process. On the other hand, China needs to provide more assistance in promoting peace-building capabilities in Africa, such as technical support, staff training, and equipment. In other words, China should be an all-dimensional participant in the process of peace building in Africa, engaging in specific peacekeeping operation and helping African countries increase their own peace-building and peace-keeping capabilities. Historically, the China-Africa friendship was built on the foundations of political equality and mutual support and respect. Today, China has the ability to safeguard the legitimate rights of African countries in international affairs. Beyond that, China should play an active role in enhancing the voice and representation rights of African countries in international organizations. For example China can clearly and persistently support Africa efforts to join as permanent members of the UN Security Council and increase their weight in the IMF, World Bank, and other institutions. This is not only an important means of balancing global power distribution, it is significant manifestation of China's African responsibility. Combining principles and innovation to ensure the sustainable, healthy and stable development of relations. To lay a solid foundation for the ongoing development of China-Africa relations, the Chinese -African relations, the Chinese government needs to establish confidence in its African diplomacy. In fact, compared to other countries, China has some advantages in this regard. First, China -Africa relations have a clear direction. At the 2006 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China -Africa Cooperation Chinese and African leaders jointly proposed the construction of a China-Africa New strategic partnership, the core of which is political equality and mutual trust, economic win-win Cooperation, and cultural exchanges and mutual learning. The partnership is based on the principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefits, tolerance and mutual learning, which is in time with Africa's development interests and has a lasting vitality. Such as a clear strategic vision provides an important political assurance for the smooth and steady development of bilateral relations. Second, ChinaâAfrica relations have a clear development road map - China's new administration has specific African policy initiative. For instance, China will continue to expand investment and financing cooperation with Africa and provide 30 billion dollars in loan credits to Africa in three years, and take part in cross-border and inter-regional African infrastructure construction. China will train 30,000 African professional in various sectors, after 18,000 government scholarships, and take steps to improve the content and quality of the training programs in three years. Beijing has promised to grant zero-tariff treatment to 97 percent of exports from least developed countries that have established diplomatic relations with China. These specific policies provide important advantages for Africa's infrastructure construction, personnel training, capital accumulation, and trade with China, which also helps strengthen China-Africa relations. Third, the Chinese government has always positioned safeguarding the interests of developing countries, including African countries, as fundamental aspect of China's diplomacy something that has earned it moral superiority in Africa. On March 28, 2013 in Durban, South Africa, President Xi Jinping speech at a breakfast meeting with African leaders, clearly stating that china will always be steadfast defender of Africa's peace and stability a firm promoter of African prosperity and development, a staunch supporter of African Unity for self-development, and firm supporter for Africa's equal participation in international affairs. This clearly defined China's policy towards relations with Africa, while bolstering its image as a responsible power change is a constant, and China's African policy is no exception as Xi said : To maintain the vitality of China-Africa relations, we must advance with the times. while adhering to the principals of mutual respects, equality mutual benefits, and win-win cooperation , China's Africa policy needs innovation that keeps pace with international realities and African and Chinese capabilities. The vitality of China's Africa strategy depends on constantly updating its policies and the institutionally mechanisms of relations, while combining China's national interests and Africa's development interests. This will maintain vigor and ensure that the relationship continues to grow. (Sudan News Agency)"

Arriving in Tashkent, Uzbekistan on the last leg of a three-nation Eurasian trip Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend the 16th Meeting of the SCO Heads of State Council, which coincides with the 15th anniversary of SCOâs establishment, to discuss future cooperation among member states. Given the significant development gaps among SCO economies and downward economic pressure, construction of the economic belt will help boost regional and multilateral cooperation for economic growth while bringing new vitality to SCO economies. The Ufa Declaration issued last July pointed out that it is of great significance for SCO nations to launch consultation and information exchanges regarding the economic belt construction since they boast favorable conditions. In terms of geological location, SCO member states, as well as observer states such as Russia, India and Pakistan, are both neighboring countries of China and countries along the route. The Eurasian Economic Union has signed a cooperation agreement with the SCO. Details are under further discussion. Besides, most of the SCO members are also founding members of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. In the principle of reciprocity and win-win cooperation, participating states share adequate space for cooperation. The SCO Development Bank and Development Fund, when established, will provide a strong impetus for cooperation regarding the Silk Road Economic Belt. Meeting mechanisms between commerce, transport and finance ministers under the SCO framework will help formulate rules for multilateral economic cooperation. Moreover, the SCO also plays an effective role in setting up long-term economic cooperation, unifying technical standards and cutting down non-tariff barriers. SCO states also face an urgent need to join and fight against the âthree evil forcesâ in the security field."

It is noted that the products made of raw materials provided by the Portuguese-speaking countries will be regarded as Macao origin. Analysis believed that more foreign investment will start manufacturing business here and take advantage of tariff-free policy to exploit the mainland market.

Top Chinese and U.S. officials wrapped up Wednesday their two-day high-level talks here with substantial outcomes in strategic and economic sectors, as well as people-to-people exchanges. (Xinhua/Yin Bogu) WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese and U.S. officials will gather on Monday in Beijing to kick off the eighth Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED), the last for the Obama administration, to discuss a wide range of economic issues from macroeconomic policy, investment treaty to industrial overcapacity and trade disputes. The annual high-level dialogue also coincides this year with China hosting the Group of 20 (G20) summit and the United States holding presidential elections. While it's too early to tell what specific outcomes the two sides could get from the two-day dialogue, past experiences suggest that maintaining regular dialogues and continued engagement between the world's two largest economies is increasingly crucial to both countries and the global economy. FED RATE HIKES & RMB EXCHANGE RATE ""I think the top priority will be, as always, talking about macroeconomic cooperation and how the two countries manage their economies. The United States remains concerned about the RMB (renminbi) exchange rate and about China' s growth,"" Rory MacFarquhar, a visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former special assistant to President Barack Obama for international economics, said of the economic track of the upcoming S&ED. ""This is a very important mechanism"" to bring together quite a large number of the U.S. Cabinet and the Chinese State Council high-levels to really hear each other's perspective on a wide range of specific issues and achieve useful outcomes, MacFarquhar told Xinhua. David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former official of the U.S. Treasury Department, said it's very important for both sides to have ""a frank conversation about macroeconomic and financial policies"" this year, as the Federal Reserve weighs its next interest rate hike in coming months. The Fed will hold its next policy meeting just a week after the China-U.S. high-level dialogue. Expectations of a Fed rate hike as soon as this summer have pushed up the value of the U.S. dollar and increased the downward pressure of the RMB, or yuan. ""China will be very interested in hearing what the Federal Reserve thinks,"" Dollar wrote in a blog post on Wednesday. ""Regardless of when the Fed moves, both China and the United States have an interest in seeing a relatively stable exchange rate for the yuan."" The policy actions of the United States and China have never been so closely connected. A relative stable RMB exchange rate will help China engineer a smooth economic transition and maintain a stable financial market, which could pave the way for the Fed to further raise interest rates. Clear communications of Fed's decision-making will also help reduce global market uncertainties and capital outflows from China, avoiding a large devaluation of the RMB to some extent. The Fed should communicate better with China and financial markets on its interest rate decisions, China's Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said Thursday, noting that the world's two largest economies should also strengthen policy coordination and cooperation. ""The most important outcome of the S&ED may well be avoidance of policy mistakes, a subtle outcome that will not be reflected in headlines,"" Dollar said. INVESTMENT TREATY TALKS Talks on a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) certainly will be high on the agenda during the upcoming S&ED as BIT negotiations have been considered the most important issue in the two nation's economic relationship. ""Near-term completion of a high quality BIT is the most significant opportunity to promote more bilateral investment,"" business leaders and former senior officials of China and the United States said in a joint statement after holding an annual dialogue last month. ""No investment relationship in the world has greater potential than that between the U.S. and China."" While participants in the dialogue conceded that they might have differences regarding the scope of a BIT, they agreed to advocate with the Chinese and U.S. governments for ""the timely conclusion of such an agreement by the end of this year."" Erin Ennis, senior vice president at U.S.-China Business Council, hoped that China would come up with a new ""negative list"" offer, which outlines sectors closed to foreign investment, during this S&ED to push forward the investment treaty talks. ""I think we have to be realistic,"" Ennis told Xinhua. ""I do worry that there's simply not enough time between now and the end of December to conclude something, if they don't work it out soon."" The last time the two sides exchanged their negative list offers was in early September last year, days ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping's state visit to the United States. A total of 24 rounds of investment treaty talks have been held since negotiations started in 2008 as both countries sought to increase mutual investment. China and U.S. officials have repeatedly signaled willingness to finalize a deal before Obama leaves the White House in January 2017. INDUSTRIAL OVERCAPACITY & TRADE DISPUTES The high-level dialogue also comes at a time when U.S. steel producers increasingly resort to trade remedy and tariff protection to ride out a sluggish steel market, as steel excess capacity has become an acute global challenge. The U.S. has overtaken India as the leading user of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations, with China and its steel sector the biggest target, according to a recently-released annual Global Trade Protection Report. The United States would encourage China to reduce excess industrial capacity in its key base metals sectors and ""make supply in these sectors more sensitive to underlying domestic and global demand conditions,"" Nathan Sheets, U.S. Treasury's undersecretary for international affairs, said last month at a Brookings event to preview the upcoming S&ED. But China opposes abuse of trade remedy measures, Zhu said Thursday, adding that both parties should abide by WTO rules and hold dialogues to solve trade disputes. ""We should oppose trade protectionism in the context of the principle of free trade, which is agreed upon by and serves the interests of both countries,"" he said. U.S. trade experts have also warned that resorting to protectionism will not cure the U.S. steel industry's grave ills, and import restrictions serve to harm the overall U.S. economy rather than help it. As bilateral trade and investment between China and the U.S. have rapidly expanded in recent years, it's inevitable that problems and contradictions will emerge. But the S&ED mechanism has played an important role in promoting mutual trust, managing differences and avoiding miscalculation in bilateral economic relations, experts said. ""As this year's S&ED will be the last under the Obama administration's leadership, I must stress that continued cooperation with China on the diverse set of issues covered in the S&ED is crucial- not just to our respective countries, but globally as well,"" Sheets said. ""The last one will be extremely important as ever, perhaps even more so, given the current election season in the United States, to demonstrate that the approach to bilateral relations of sitting down and talking through problems leads to better outcomes than the alternative approach, which involves threats and more coercive forms of interactions,"" MacFarquhar said. ""It will be important for both sides to demonstrate that engagement yields real tangible results that the peoples of both countries can actually feel, and that are contributing to create jobs and their economic wellbeing,"" he added. Dollar also agreed that this S&ED is ""a good time for China and the United States to demonstrate that regular, high-level exchange produces results, increasing the likelihood that whatever administration comes next will want to maintain something similar."""

The ministry said the country was ""strongly dissatisfied"" with the U.S. decision and would encourage its firms to legally defend their interests. Trade remedy measures recently taken by the United Stateswere protectionism, and would disrupt trade rather than solve U.S. steel industry problems, according to a statement on the ministry's website. It said current steel industry woes were global challenges that required coordinated efforts to solve. The USITC said on Thursday it would investigate a complaint by U.S. Steel Corporation of Pittsburgh, which alleged that Chinese steelmakers and distributors conspired to fix prices, stole trade secrets and misrepresented the origin of their exports to the United States. In its complaint under section 337 of the main U.S. tariff law, U.S. Steel Corp. is seeking to bar nearly all imports from China's largest steelmakers. The investigation would involve 40 Chinese steel producers and distribution subsidiaries, including Baosteel, Hebei Iron and Steel Group, Wuhan Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. and Anshan Iron and Steel Group."

The investigation is based on a complaint filed by U.S. Steel Corporation on April 26, alleging that major Chinese steel producers and their distributors conspired to fix prices and control output and export volumes, misappropriated U.S. Steel's trade secrets, were involved in false designations of origin or manufacturer, and violated the Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, the bipartisan trade panel said in a statement. U.S. Steel requested that the USITC issue a general exclusion order, a limited exclusion order, and cease-and-desist orders to bar Chinese carbon and alloy steel products from the U.S. market, the panel said. The USITC has identified around 40 Chinese steel producers and their distributors as respondents in this Section 337 investigation. The investigation does not mean that the panel has made any decision on the merits of the case. Within 45 days, the panel will set a target date for completing the investigation. Should the complaint be approved, the panel will issue an import ban on infringing products and bar the sale of products within the United States. An unnamed official with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said last month that he hoped the USITC would overrule the charges as the provision cited by U.S Steel had mostly been used in intellectual property rights (IPR) dispute cases. ""Steel products are relatively mature and there are no IPR disputes regarding them. Charges of IPR infringement are groundless,"" the official said. Section 337 investigations usually focus on allegations of patent or registered trademark infringement, and also involve misappropriation of such aspects as trade secrets, false advertising, and violation of the antitrust laws. The case comes at a time when U.S. steelmakers increasingly resort to trade remedies and tariff protection to ride out a sluggish steel market, as steel excess capacity has become an acute global challenge. But U.S. manufacturers have complained that steelmakers cannot produce all types of steel, and import restrictions could undermine their global competitiveness. ""The U.S. steel industry cannot supply all of the steel needed by U.S. steel consuming industries no matter the state of the global steel market,"" Rob Harris, managing director of the U.S. Industrial Fasteners Institute, said in a written testimony for a public hearing on the global steel industry situation last month. ""Broad trade remedies and legislative actions that affect steel of all kinds may produce temporary relief for a small number of steel producers, but they are blunt instruments that may also have unintended negative consequences on steel consumers,"" Harris said. He urged the Obama administration to carefully consider the global nature of manufacturing supply chains and the impacts of any further trade enforcement tools on the availability and price of steel. U.S. trade experts have also warned that protectionism will not cure the U.S. steel industry's grave ills, and import restrictions harm the overall U.S. economy rather than help it. ""With domestic (steel) producers still suffering despite so much protection, it seems implausible to expect that a few more restrictions would alleviate their financial stress,"" said Daniel Pearson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and former chairman at the USITC. ""The relative sizes of the steel-producing and steel-consuming sectors make clear why the United States loses when it imposes import restraints,"" Pearson argued. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce has repeatedly said the steel industries in the United States and China should strengthen dialogue and communication to jointly address the issue of overcapacity, which is a result of the anemic global economic recovery and a tepid demand. China will take all necessary measures to gain fair treatment and safeguard the interests of Chinese steel enterprises, the ministry said."

The adjustments suggested that the new rules should be postponed for one year. During the one-year transition period, cross-border retailers could make preparation for new regulation. This comes just one month after China ushered in a new tax policy that requires products bought on cross border e-commerce platforms to be subject to import tariffs. In fact, it's the third adjustments for the new restrictions on online imports. Earlier, authorities did some fine-tuning in the policy of importing goods for the first time, then, the second batch of ""positive list"" was unveiled to cover more commodities. Between Thursday and Saturday, several ministries and other authorities, including the Ministry of Commerce, the General Administration of Customs, and the Ministry of Finance, did some intensive research on the effect of the new policy, and solicited opinions from some online retail websites such as Tmall Global, Jumei.com, vip.com, and xiaohongshu.com. During the meeting, authorities made clear that the nation will support cross-border e-commerce, with focus on B2B and exports. However, it doesn't mean the development of B2C will be restricted. A person who attended the meeting held in Henan Friday told Shanghai Securities News that representatives from several cross-border online shopping platforms hope the new rules could be delayed for a while, and the country should define a new trade management category for cross-border e-commerce. They also hoped that during the implementation of the new policy, a ""positive list"" can stand for an entry license, and cancel customs clearance certificates. The adoption of transition period is within expectation, said Zhang Li, deputy director of e-commerce research department under the Ministry of Commerce. New policy for cross-border e-businesses was adopted too hastily, and the country should take a soft measure and give enterprise some time to adapt it, Zhang added."

The vitamin maker on Friday announced it had acquired leading local Chinese medicine manufacturer and distributor Global Therapeutics, a group that currently commands an estimated 80 percent share of the Chinese herbal remedy market in Australia, for 17 million U.S. dollars. Global Therapeutics, based out of the coastal city of Byron Bay, has two main brands Fusion and Oriental Botanicals which are currently only sold in Australia. But with the Chinese natural-remedy market said to be worth 125 million U.S. dollars worldwide per annum, Blackmores' chief executive Christine Holgate said the group would look to push into the world's most populous country, China. ""It's not going to happen overnight but there is a fantastic opportunity,"" Holgate told Fairfax Media on Friday. ""It will enable us to better understand the Chinese consumer and get closer to them."" Last year, the Federal government removed its pre-existing 4-6 percent tariff on Australian pharmaceutical exports, such as vitamins, to China by signing the Chinese-Australian Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA). By 2019, 95 percent of Australian healthcare exports must be tariff-free to satisfy the terms of the historic document. In the past 12 months alone, Global Therapeutics' domestic sales have increased by 24 percent, Holgate said. Holgate said Australia currently has more than 4,700 registered Chinese medicine practitioners, and the market showed no signs of slowing down. Despite Blackmores' success on the Australian Stock Exchange, largely stemming from the massive demand in China for its ""clean and green"" vitamin products, Holman said there was still room for improving its range. Holgate said Blackmores' upper management had identified natural remedies as one of the company's biggest weaknesses. ""It's the natural medicine part we've not been strong in,"" she said on Friday. Asian buyers now make up around 50 percent of Blackmores' total sales, a figure that could likely expand through exporting Fusion and Oriental Botanicals. Blackmores has no plans to rebrand the Fusion and Oriental Botanicals for the Chinese market, Holgate said."

Last week saw tens of thousands of German steel workers go on strike over steel products from China, and Indian giant Tata's closing of mills in Britain also drew a media flurry against so-called dumping from China. Analysts said it's convenient for the West to point the finger at China and indulge in domestic populism for its own good. But such a poorly thought out strategy won't help lift the world out of its steel woes and serve instead to strengthen the protectionist bent of some developed economies. CHINA: CULPRIT OR SCAPEGOAT? The fact that China is the world's largest steel producer and consumer has made it vulnerable to Western critics. But Zhang Ji, assistant minister of China's Ministry of Commerce (MOC), blamed ""the slow recovery of the world economy"" and ""sluggish demand"" for the current steel glut. ""In recent years, 85-95 percent of steel produced by China has been for domestic consumption. China's annual steel consumption accounts for 45 percent of the global in total,"" he said Monday in an interview with Xinhua. In order to rein in production, China has stopped issuing new licenses for steel projects and begun shutting down outdated facilities. China also announced earlier this year that it will continue to reduce crude steel capacity by 100 million to 150 million tons in the next five years. Doing so would cost China 100 billion RMB in re-employing over 500,000 laid-off steel workers. ""None of the money will subsidize steel exports,"" said Zhang. ""China has no subsidy policies to stimulate steel exports; instead, it has leveraged export tariffs on some steel products ... The export tariff for billet is 20 percent and for hot-rolled wire rod 15 percent."" In this context, China's crude steel production in 2015 has decreased 1.92 percent year on year, the first annual decline since 1981, with the capacity utilization rate souring to 71.2 percent, higher than the global average of 69.7 percent. To boost domestic demand, Zhang revealed that China has began large-scale infrastructure projects like the rebuilding of dilapidated houses. The automobile, machinery equipment, power and shipping sectors will see their consumption of steel rise as well. Expect demand for steel to soar to ensure China's Belt and Road initiative becomes a reality. WESTERN SOLUTION: PROTECTIONISM, PERIOD Analysts said the West's solution to the current steel issue is riddled in protectionism and China bashing. At the Brussels gathering, Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker and Trade Representative Michael Froman attributed the ""fundamental structural problems"" in the global steel industry to China, threatening ""trade action"" by ""affected governments including the United States,"" if Beijing does not take actions ""timely and concrete"" enough to satisfy Washington's demands. The situation on the other side of the Atlantic hasn't been much better. The European Commission issued a policy paper in March, vowing to implement trade remedies and proactive regulation regarding steel imports. In an overt gesture to single out China, the agency has 16 protective measures aimed directly at China; six of ten steel products under its investigation are related to China; the organization is investigating three Chinese mills and inflicting punitive tariffs on two steel imports. Moreover, China's exports to European nations, such as Britain and Germany, account for a small fraction of their imports both in volume and sales, not to mention that its exports are mostly of the low value-added variety, such as ordinary steel rods and plates, which many European countries no longer make and have to import anyway. Furthermore, Europe's accusations are ignorant of the fact that the fundamental reason for its undynamic steel companies and low profits lies in high costs including labor. Experts say that the United States and Europe should be more constructive in solving the industry's problems rather than engaging in a war of words with China. Excess capacity is a ""shared problem"" that ""needs to be tackled through joint efforts,"" said a position paper disseminated by the Chinese delegation during the Brussels meeting. ""Frequent use of trade remedy measures and other import-restrictive measures does not address the root cause of global steel overcapacity, and is detrimental to the division of labor and cooperation,"" noted the paper, adding that China champions free and open international trade for the steel industry."

""The first trade mission (in 2014) translated into significant trade and investment outcomes for Australia - around 760 million U.S. dollars in export sales were generated and more than 2.4 billion U.S. dollars in investment followed the event,"" Ciobo said. ""We anticipate that the breadth and scale of AWIC 2016 will generate similar outcomes and be the catalyst for significant export sales and investments into Australia, further driving jobs and growth."" He said the ChAFTA, which was signed late last year, would only continue to deliver more investment and trade opportunities between China and Australia."

The implementation, which will come into effect on April 8, will offer cross-border businesses as well as traditional retailers a more fair competition mechanism. As Chinese customers' overseas shopping spree and cross-border e-commerce craze get red hot, despite of a 7 percent downfall in China's import and export data, the growth rate of cross-border e-commerce went up to 30 percent. As a much debated tax, personal postal articles tax is levied on cross-border e-commerce retailers. According to Wang Wei, director of Institute of Market Economy of Development Research Center of the State Council, in the early stage of cross-border e-commerce development, China levies personal postal articles tax on retailers, which is a collective tax including imported goods tariff , import value-added tax and consumption tax. China levies personal postal articles tax on imported goods which are under 1,000 yuan, and the tax rate are mostly 10 percent. Goods with taxes under 50 yuan are exempt from Customs tax, said Wang. It is an important reason why cross-border e-commerce is quite popular since compared to traditional import trade, the tax burden level is relatively low, according to Wang. As more people demand overseas goods, the online purchasing agent takes advantage of personal postal articles tax and ditched the old way of wholesales and adopted new methods such as repackaging and mailing products separately to avoid tax. Statistics showed that in 2014, cross-border e-commerce and overseas consumptions reached hundreds of billions of yuan, however, the personal postal articles tax was under 1.3 billion yuan, which shows a big loss of tax revenue. The new policy only allows a maximum of 2,000 yuan of single transfer in cross-border retail and a maximum of 20,000 yuan per person per year. ""Within the range, the tax rate is set for zero percent temporarily,"" said authority with Ministry of Finance. Any goods that exceed the range will be levied full tax on general trade. The tax rate is indeed higher compared to what it used to be but it won't affect consumers too much, authority with Ministry of Finance said."

Since the start of the 1990s, the areas in which local authorities have competed include foreign direct investment, new airports with direct flights to popular overseas destinations, sprawling urban plans featuring exotic public buildings or office buildings, and high-speed rail services. But what next, with the economy undergoing a difficult transition and almost every industry seeing a slowdown in growth? News emerging from provincial-level policymaking meetings held before the annual session of the National People's Congress in March is that setting up local free trade zones will mark the next stage of the nation's development. Local governments will embark on a new round of competition to obtain central government approval for such zones and to show who can run a local FTZ most successfully. Commerce officials say that the competition will probably continue throughout the nation's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20). Also called tariff-free zones, FTZs are areas within which goods can be imported, processed and exported without going through customs inspections. Foreign investors can set up facilities in industries that are restricted elsewhere in the country. FTZs are designed to provide greater access and convenience for foreign companies to expand in China and for Chinese companies to move money abroad â in diverse services and financial operations, as well as in manufacturing."

Following is an English version of the paper: China's Arab Policy Paper January 2016 Foreword Friendship between China and Arab states dates back to ancient times. Over two thousand years ago, land and maritime Silk Roads already linked the Chinese and Arab nations. In the long stretches of history, peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, learning from each other, mutual benefit and win-win results have always been the main theme of exchanges between China and Arab countries. The founding of the People's Republic of China and the independence of Arab countries created a new era for China-Arab friendly exchanges. From 1956 to 1990, China established diplomatic relations with all 22 Arab countries. China firmly supports Arab national liberation movement, firmly supports Arab countries' struggle to uphold sovereignty and territorial integrity, pursue and safeguard national interests, and combat external interference and aggression, and firmly supports Arab countries' cause of developing the national economy and building up the countries. Arab countries have given China strong support in restoring its lawful seat at the United Nations and on issues like the Taiwan question. After the end of the Cold War, both China and Arab countries have followed the world trend of peace, development and cooperation, respected each other, treated each other as equals, and committed themselves to deepening the traditional friendship and the bilateral relations. Cooperation in political, trade and economic, scientific and technological, cultural and educational, military, health, sports, news,and other fields has achieved fruitful results, thus enabling the establishment of the friendly and cooperative relationship oriented toward the 21st century. In 2004, China-Arab States Cooperation Forum was set up. Since then, it has developed into a collective cooperation platform covering many fields and with more than ten mechanisms. In 2010, China and Arab countries established the strategic cooperative relations of comprehensive cooperation and common development, and China-Arab collective cooperation entered a new stage of comprehensive development and upgrading. President Xi Jinping delivered an important speech at the opening ceremony of the Sixth Ministerial Conference of China-Arab States Cooperation Forum, identifying key areas and priority directions of China-Arab collective cooperation, and providing guidance for the development of the China-Arab relations and the Forum. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Arab countries 60 years ago, cooperation in all fields has been constantly deepened. China has built comprehensive strategic partnership, strategic partnership or strategic cooperative partnership with eight Arab countries, and has set up a strategic dialogue mechanism with the Gulf Cooperation Council. Arab countries as a whole have become China's biggest supplier of crude oil and the 7th biggest trading partner. China's proposed initiatives of jointly building the ""Silk Road Economic Belt"" and the ""21st Century Maritime Silk Road"", establishing a ""1+2+3"" cooperation pattern (to take energy cooperation as the core,infrastructure construction and trade and investment facilitation as the two wings, and three high and new tech fields of nuclear energy, space satellite and new energy as the three breakthroughs), and industrial capacity cooperation, are well received by Arab countries. Both sides have broad consensus on safeguarding state sovereignty and territorial integrity, defending national dignity, seeking political resolution to hotspot issues, and promoting peace and stability in the Middle East. We share similar views on issues such as reform of the United Nations, climate change and Doha Round trade negotiations, and maintain sound coordination and cooperation. Cultural and educational exchanges are more frequent and people-to-people ties are getting closer with enhanced mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples. Over the past 60 years, China-Arab friendly cooperation has made historic leaps in breadth and depth. It has become a model of South-South cooperation and gained the following successful experience: both sides have always respected and treated each other as equals and remained brothers, friends and partners no matter what happens on the world arena; both sides have insisted on the principle of mutual benefit, win-win and common development and have pursued common interests and sustainable development no matter what changes or developments take place on either side; and both sides have promoted dialogue, exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations, and have always respected each other's social system and development path no matter what differences exist in ideology. The Chinese government has issued the first China's Arab Policy Paper on the basis of reviewing and summarizing the experience in the development of China-Arab relations. It stipulates the guiding principle for developing China-Arab relations, offers the blueprint for China-Arab mutually beneficial cooperation, and reiterates the political will of commitment to peace and stability in the Middle East, in order to promote China-Arab relations to a new and higher level. Part I Deepen China-Arab Strategic Cooperative Relations of Comprehensive Cooperation and Common Development The world is experiencing profound and complex changes. The trend toward a multipolar world and economic globalization is deepening, and cultural diversity and the information society continue to move forward. Changes in the international configuration and international order are accelerating. All countries in the world are seizing the opportunity to readjust their development strategies, promote reform and innovation, speed up economic transformation and open up new development horizons. At the same time, the world economy is still in a period of deep transformation, with geopolitical factors becoming more prominent, regional turbulences rising one after another, non-traditional security and global challenges increasing and the gap between the North and the South widening. It remains an arduous journey to advance mankind's noble cause of peace and development. China is the largest developing country in the world and is working hard to realize the two centenary goals and the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation, which is to build a strong, prosperous, democratic, culturally-advanced and harmonious modern socialist country. China will continue to uphold the banner of peace, development and win-win cooperation, be committed to peaceful development, pursue a win-win strategy of opening up and promote the formation of a new type of international relations featuring win-win cooperation. Arab states are situated in the converging area of the Asian and African continents, characterized by religious and cultural diversities, time-honored culture and history, unique resource endowment and great potentials for development. Currently, Arab states are independently exploring the development paths suited to their own national realities. They are committed to pursuing industrialization, enhancing employment and improving people's livelihood. They are active in promoting peace and stability in the region and are playing important roles in regional and international affairs. China and Arab states are both developing countries with their combined territory, population and economic aggregate accounting for 1/6, 1/4 and 1/8 of the world's total respectively. Different in natural endowment and development level, China and Arab countries are all in an important development stage and have a shared mission of rejuvenating the nation. We need to collaborate with each other more closely, and learn from each other along the road of development, strengthen cooperation in seeking common development and promoting regional peace, and echo each other in building a new type of international relations, so as to safeguard state sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and to promote stability, economic development and well-being of our peoples. China will continue to carry forward China-Arab traditional friendship, enrich and deepen our all-round, multi-layer, wide-ranging cooperation, promote sustainable and sound development of our strategic cooperative relations featuring all-round cooperation and common development, and safeguard peace, stability and development of the region and the world at large. (more) Part II China's Arab Policy Arab states are China's important partners in following the peaceful development path, strengthening unity and cooperation among developing countries and establishing a new type of international relations with win-win cooperation at its core. China has always approached the China-Arab relations from a strategic height. It is China's long-held diplomatic principle to consolidate and deepen China-Arab traditional friendship. China will adhere to the right approach to justice and interests and promote peace, stability and development of Arab states while seeking better development of China, to achieve win-win cooperation,common development and a better future of the China-Arab strategic and cooperative relations. China upholds the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, namely,mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence. China supports the Middle East peace process and the establishment of an independent state of Palestine with full sovereignty, based on the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. China supports the Arab League and its member states' efforts to this end. We adhere to political solution to regional hot spot issues, and support the establishment of a nuclear weapon-free and WMD-free zone in the Middle East. We support positive efforts made by Arab states in strengthening unity, curbing the spread of extremist thoughts and fighting terrorism. China respects choices made by the Arab people, and supports Arab states in exploring their own development paths suited to their national conditions. We hope to enhance the sharing of governance experience with Arab states. China is willing to have pragmatic cooperation in the principle of mutual benefit and win-win results with Arab states. In particular, in the process of jointly pursuing the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road initiative, China is willing to coordinate development strategies with Arab states, put into play each other's advantages and potentials, promote international production capacity cooperation and enhance cooperation in the fields of infrastructure construction, trade and investment facilitation, nuclear power, space satellite, new energy, agriculture and finance, so as to achieve common progress and development and benefit our two peoples. China is willing to cooperate with Arab states to promote the new type of cooperation mechanism featuring openness and reciprocality, mutual benefit and win-win results. According to Arab states' needs, China will continue to provide assistance within our means to Arab states through bilateral and multilateral channels, to help them improve self-development capability and people's livelihood. China is willing to work with Arab states to contribute to diversified development and mutual learning among world civilizations. We will enhance people-to-people exchanges, strengthen cooperation in such areas as science, education, culture, health, radio, film and television, deepen understanding and friendship between the two peoples, promote mutual learning and integration between the two cultures, build a communication bridge between the two peoples, and jointly contribute to the progress of human civilization. China is willing to strengthen consultation and coordination with Arab states, and jointly uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, implement the United Nations 2030 Agenda for sustainable development, safeguard international equity and justice, and make the international order more fair and just. On major international issues, such as the United Nations reform, climate change, food and energy security, both sides respect each other's core interests and major concerns, support each other's justifiable demand and reasonable propositions, and staunchly safeguard the common interests of developing countries. Part III Strengthen China-Arab Cooperation in an All-around Manner 1. Political Cooperation 1.1 High-Level Exchanges We will keep the momentum of high-level exchanges and dialogues, make full use of meetings between high-level officials to guide the development of China-Arab relations.

We support the UN in playing a leading role in maintaining peace, promoting common development and enhancing international cooperation. We support the UN to undergo necessary and reasonable reforms and increase the representation and voice of developing countries, including Arab states, at the UN Security Council. 1.5 The Taiwan Question The Taiwan question concerns the core interests of China. The one China principle is the important basis for China to establish and develop relations with Arab states and regional organizations. Arab states and regional organizations have always been committed to the one China principle, refrained from having any official relations or official exchanges with Taiwan, and supported China in peaceful development of cross-Straits relations and the great cause of national reunification. China appreciates all these. 2.

388,http://english.people.com.cn/n3/2016/0106/c90000-8999540.html,"New World wine, tastes so divine for Chinese","January 06, 2016","A woman checks a bottle of imported Australian wine at a tariff-free zone in Nantong, Jiangsu province. [Photo/China Daily] Ready to get heady, China's growing middle class finds new ways to fill the glass Wines from the New Worldï¼countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Chileï¼are growing a presence in the recovering market in China. For instance, Treasury Wine Estates, Australia's largest winemaker, is cashing in on the demand for good-value drinks in China. Robert Foy, TWE's managing director for Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, said the company expects to make its brand Wolf Blass the top imported wine by sales volume in China within five years. Wine appreciation, he said, now marks the modern lifestyle of the growing middle class in China. ""Awareness and demand for New World wines have definitely been on the rise in the past decade, which we expect to continue to grow in the coming time. In fact, we believe the love for wine has just begun in China."" TWE has seven brands in China, including Wolf Blass, Penfolds and Beringer. Wolf Blass has recently announced a partnership with basketball league body NBA China, which will allow the company to reach more than 330 million potential wine consumers in the country. After significant decline in volume growth since 2012 due to the impact of the government's anti-extravagance campaign, the wine market is finally showing signs of recovery, especially with imports growing. Domestic brands are facing fierce competition in the mid-range, according to a report in October from Mintel Group Ltd, a United Kingdom-based consumption consultancy firm. China is the world's largest wine-buying country. Double-digit growth marked imports in the past five years, according to industry data. After a sharp fall from 18.7 percent year-on-year growth rate in 2012 to 1.4 percent in 2014, volume growth in the wine market in China is estimated to bounce back to 4.6 percent in 2015, said Mintel. Consumers in China are relatively open to new choices, said Foy. ""They have high interest and curiosity in trying different wine products, so they are willing to try New World wines. ""Despite sales slowdown in very high-end wines, people have switched to products with a higher price-performance ratio but also of a reputable and consistent quality."" Foy said the demand for imported New World wines is still extremely high and the local wine market is just beginning to tap the unharnessed potential. Carrie Huang, a management executive in Shanghai, said she buys 12 bottles of wine a month. She prefers wine from the New World. Its labels in English clearly explain the constitution of the wine and the taste. This, she said, helps her to select the wine of her choice. She said New World wine taste is direct and simple compared with the complicated attributes of wine from the Old Worldï¼mainly wine-producing countries in Europe. ""Since I spend my own money on wine, I choose wine that gives value for money."" The main wine distribution channels in China are supermarkets, hypermarkets, convenience stores and online retailers. TWE has signed distribution deals with select online retailers in China such as JD.com Inc, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's Tmall and wangjiu.com. ""E-commerce is an important channel for us to expand the distribution of our wines beyond first-tier cities into the hands of consumers that rely on online shopping in the second- and third-tier cities,"" said Foy.

[Photo/China Daily] Ready to get heady, China's growing middle class finds new ways to fill the glass Wines from the New Worldï¼countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Chileï¼are growing a presence in the recovering market in China. For instance, Treasury Wine Estates, Australia's largest winemaker, is cashing in on the demand for good-value drinks in China. Robert Foy, TWE's managing director for Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, said the company expects to make its brand Wolf Blass the top imported wine by sales volume in China within five years. Wine appreciation, he said, now marks the modern lifestyle of the growing middle class in China. ""Awareness and demand for New World wines have definitely been on the rise in the past decade, which we expect to continue to grow in the coming time. In fact, we believe the love for wine has just begun in China."" TWE has seven brands in China, including Wolf Blass, Penfolds and Beringer. Wolf Blass has recently announced a partnership with basketball league body NBA China, which will allow the company to reach more than 330 million potential wine consumers in the country. After significant decline in volume growth since 2012 due to the impact of the government's anti-extravagance campaign, the wine market is finally showing signs of recovery, especially with imports growing. Domestic brands are facing fierce competition in the mid-range, according to a report in October from Mintel Group Ltd, a United Kingdom-based consumption consultancy firm. China is the world's largest wine-buying country. Double-digit growth marked imports in the past five years, according to industry data. After a sharp fall from 18.7 percent year-on-year growth rate in 2012 to 1.4 percent in 2014, volume growth in the wine market in China is estimated to bounce back to 4.6 percent in 2015, said Mintel. Consumers in China are relatively open to new choices, said Foy. ""They have high interest and curiosity in trying different wine products, so they are willing to try New World wines. ""Despite sales slowdown in very high-end wines, people have switched to products with a higher price-performance ratio but also of a reputable and consistent quality."" Foy said the demand for imported New World wines is still extremely high and the local wine market is just beginning to tap the unharnessed potential. Carrie Huang, a management executive in Shanghai, said she buys 12 bottles of wine a month. She prefers wine from the New World. Its labels in English clearly explain the constitution of the wine and the taste. This, she said, helps her to select the wine of her choice. She said New World wine taste is direct and simple compared with the complicated attributes of wine from the Old Worldï¼mainly wine-producing countries in Europe. ""Since I spend my own money on wine, I choose wine that gives value for money."" The main wine distribution channels in China are supermarkets, hypermarkets, convenience stores and online retailers. TWE has signed distribution deals with select online retailers in China such as JD.com Inc, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's Tmall and wangjiu.com. ""E-commerce is an important channel for us to expand the distribution of our wines beyond first-tier cities into the hands of consumers that rely on online shopping in the second- and third-tier cities,"" said Foy. The company is also leveraging social media platforms such as WeChat and Weibo to reach consumers and ensure social media engagement. However, the challenge for TWE is that wine drinkers in China switch from one variety or brand to another rather quickly. It is also keen to capitalize on the ""premiumization effect"" in which drinkers move up its brand portfolio as their incomes grow and knowledge of wine increases, said Foy."

Both FTAs, one between China and the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the other between China and Australia, set examples for cooperation between major economies during a time of downturn, which usually gives rise to protectionism. Under the deals, China will gradually abolish tariffs on 91 percent of ROK goods and 97 percent of Australian products. After a grace period, the ROK will eliminate tariffs on 92 percent of Chinese products, while Australia will eventually impose zero tariffs on all Chinese goods. Among all the FTAs China has signed with other nations, the deal with the ROK involves the biggest trade volume, and the one with Australia brings trade and investment thresholds the lowest. The pacts show the right solution to the sagging world economy: freer trade and open minds. Their benefits are substantial. Australian farm produce exports to China will have their average tariff level reduced to 0.51 percent from 12.94 percent after the grace period. China and the ROK will have a 12-trillion-U.S.-dollar low-tariff market between the them. The two agreements are just part of a broader picture: China now has 14 FTAs involving 22 countries and regions. It is negotiating for several more. FTAs will become a significant platform for China to translate its economic potential into a source of growth for foreign countries. Chinese leaders expect the country to import goods worth 10 trillion U.S. dollars and invest 500 billion U.S. dollars overseas in the coming five years. The pacts are also in line with China's call to foster a global free trade network. Last week, the State Council, China's cabinet, said the country wants to raise the proportion of trade with FTA partners in total foreign trade to that of most developed countries. In the longer term, it said, China aims to expand the free trade network to cover all neighboring countries and regions, countries within the Belt and Road network, most emerging economies, big developing countries, major regional economic groups, and parts of the developed world. With the ROK and Australia being two economic heavyweights in the Asia-Pacific region, the new FTAs are big strides forward. It's worth noting that bilateral FTAs do not necessarily run contrary to multilateral trade deals. Instead, the fruits they bear will provide grounds for accelerating talks on a region-wide free trade pact. China has long supported establishing a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) and amalgamating various regional trade arrangements to avoid fragmentation. China has a lot to gain by opening up more to the outside world. The introduction of foreign products and services will stimulate domestic innovation and upgrading, while an expanded overseas market can offer more opportunities to competitive firms from China. Cooperation can only help, not hinder, our efforts to ride out hard times. With all the benefits to China and the rest of the world, the newly implemented FTAs and the message they send deserve applause."

Korea FTA officially comes into force,"December 20, 2015","The free trade agreement (FTA) between China and South Korea will officially come into force from Sunday, providing an opportunity for the two countries to push forward their already-close cooperation partnership further. Seoul's trade ministry said Saturday that it is widely anticipated here to expand presence of South Korean companies in the world's largest consumer market and boost bilateral relations in trade and economy. China is South Korea's largest trading partner, with Chinese exports accounting for over a quarter of the total during the January-November period of this year alone. South Korea stands as China's third-biggest single-country partner of trade. Under the deal, both countries will eliminate tariff on more than 90 percent of traded goods within 20 years after the implementation. As the FTA gets effective before the end of this year, the tariff cut will enter the second year in less than two weeks after the implementation. According to Seoul's estimates, South Korean manufacturers are forecast to see exports to China grow $1.35 billion thanks to the implemented FTA within a year. If the liberalized trade reaches its goal 20 years later, South Korean companies are expected to reduce tariff costs by up to 5.44 billion dollars annually, much higher than tariff savings of 930 million dollars from the South Korea-US FTA and 1.38 billion dollars from the South Korea-EU FTA. South Korea expected the FTA with China to help raise its real GDP by 0.96 percentage points, create 53,800 jobs and enhance consumer benefits by 14.6 billion dollars."

On the China-Australia FTA side, the talks began in April 2005 and the agreement was officially signed in June 2015. The China-Australia FTA took a giant leap in October when the agreement gained bipartisan support in Australia's parliament and secured legislative approval. Upon full implementation of the agreement, tariffs will be lifted on 95 percent of Australian exports, hurdles will be lowered for Chinese businesses to invest in Australia and more visas will be granted for Chinese. The implementation of the FTAs is an important event in developing Chinaâs economic and trade relations with the two countries. The FTAs will further expand bilateral trade and investment, facilitate the free flow of capital, goods and people and improve the trade and investment environment."

Najib, whose country takes on the ASEAN rotating chair this year, made the announcement while addressing the signing ceremony of the 2015 Kuala Lumpur Declaration on the Establishment of the ASEAN Community and the Kuala Lumpur Declaration on ASEAN 2025: Forging Ahead Together. The ASEAN Community comprises three pillars: the Political and Security Community, the Economic Community and the Socio-Cultural Community. ""In practice, We have already virtually eliminated tariff barriers between us under the ASEAN Free Trade Area. This makes our manufacturing industry more competitive in the global market and reduces costs for everyone,"" the prime minister said. ""We now have to ensure that we create a truly single market and production base, with freer movement of goods and services."" The bloc's combined GDP is expected to reach 4.7 trillion U.S. dollars by 2020, and it is estimated that ASEAN has the potential to be the fourth largest economy in the world as early as 2030, only 15 years from now, Najib commented. ""Our 'ASEAN Way' has guided us, and will continue to be our compass as we seek to realize a politically cohesive, economically integrated, socially responsible, and truly people-oriented, people-centered and rules-based ASEAN."" The ASEAN Community is a landmark achievement on the way to reach those goals, Najib added. The 27th ASEAN Summit and Related Meetings are held here over the weekend with the theme ""Our people, Our Community, Our Vision"". Founded in 1967, ASEAN groups Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam.

The initial framework agreement, signed on Nov. 4, 2002 in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, was designed to establish a free trade area among the 11 nations by 2010. The free trade area came into effect on Jan. 1, 2010. The ACFTA is the largest free trade area in the world in terms of population and third largest in terms of nominal GDP, trailing the European Economic Area and North American Free Trade Area. Under the free trade agreement, tariffs will be reduced to zero on 7,881 product categories, or 90 percent of imported goods. This reduction already took effect in China and the six original members of ASEAN: Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. The remaining four countries will follow suit in 2015. The average tariff rate on Chinese goods sold in ASEAN countries decreased from 12.8 percent to 0.6 percent starting Jan. 1, 2010. Meanwhile, the average tariff rate on ASEAN goods sold in China decreased from 9.8 percent to 0.1 percent. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in 2013 called for an ""upgraded version"" of the ACFTA, pledging economic and trade cooperation of ""a greater scope and higher quality."" The decision by leaders of China and ASEAN member states to negotiate for an upgraded version of the FTA is made to meet the demand for restructuring and upgrading their respective economies and is also a new move to further enhance the China-ASEAN strategic cooperative relationship. The ACFTA has played a leading role in the overall economic integration in East Asia and also made great contribution to the liberalization of global trade. Progress has been made in comprehensive and in-depth consultation on goods and services trade, investment and economic and technological cooperation since the first round began in Hanoi, Vietnam in September 2013. China-ASEAN economic cooperation has never been more dynamic and fruitful, as China has become ASEAN's largest trading partner and ASEAN has emerged as China's third biggest trading partner with bilateral trade growing by more than 20 percent annually on average and surging by 37 times over the past two decades. At the 18th ASEAN-China, Japan and South Korea (10+3) leaders' meeting here, Premier Li said China's talks with ASEAN on the upgrading of ACFTA will end soon. The two sides are targeting their bilateral trade at 500 billion U.S. dollars by 2015 and 1 trillion dollars by 2020."

This yearâs meeting takes place under the motto chosen by the Philippines presidency â Building inclusive economies, building a better world. For a long time trade has been the driving force of economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region and other parts of the world. However, as the effect of tariff liberalisation started to wear off, it became clear that we need additional agreements covering services, investment, non-tariff barriers, competition policy, and subsidies. Of course, we cannot reach such agreements without complicated negotiations and mutual concessions. Deeper regional economic integration offers us a possible way out of the current situation. Today, Russia and its close neighbours â Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan â have taken successful steps to develop the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). Our integration project is based on the WTOâs universal, transparent principles and is designed from the outset to work together with other countries and their organisations. In May this year, we signed a free trade agreement between the EAEU and Vietnam. Another 40 countries are examining the possibility of signing similar agreements. One example of responsible and transparent partnership is the agreement to converge our EAEU project with Chinaâs Silk Road Economic Belt initiative. This will allow us to resolve a number of bottlenecks in transport infrastructure and procedures for cross-border movement of goods and services. It will also give a big boost to effective integration of the Asia-Pacific economies. We hope to reach mutually advantageous agreements on traditional and renewable energy sources, emergency and disaster response, food security and agriculture at the Russia-ASEAN summit next year in Sochi. Overall, the creation of new free trade zones will help to create good conditions for liberalising trade and investment flows in the region. At the same time however, the way the confidential fashion in which the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations were conducted is probably not the best way to facilitate sustainable growth in the Asia-Pacific region. We believe that the strategic road ahead lies not only in increasing the number of free trade zones, but also in joint development and implementation of the best liberalisation practices among all APEC members, taking into account each otherâs positions and interests. In this respect, we should continue our course of bolstering APECâs role as a coordinator of various integration initiatives aimed at developing in the region a common and open market, free of discrimination and bloc-based barriers. Here, effective implementation of the Beijing Roadmap for APECâs Contribution to the Realization of the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific, approved in Beijing in 2014, is particularly important. Realising the APEC economiesâ development potential will take more than just reaching agreement on the rules of the game for todayâs trade flows. We need to work out common approaches to development and regulation of the emerging markets that make up the digital technology-based ânew economyâ. We need to put in place the institutions and rules that will contribute to development and create new opportunities for our countriesâ business people to create modern, promising products and high quality jobs. Russia, for its part, is active in the work of the regionâs new financial institutions â the [New Development] Bank BRICS and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. I am sure that their work will help to develop the region and will also help to make the global financial system stronger and more stable. At the national level, Russia continues its efforts to create the most comfortable business climate. Our efforts have received international appraisal and over the last 4 years, Russia has moved up 69 points in the World Bankâs Doing Business rating, from 120th place to 51st place. We place great importance on developing the potential of Russiaâs Far East. This year, we began developing the priority development areas â economic zones offering what for Russia are unprecedented tax and other incentives. A special law was passed on a free port in Vladivostok. We plan to extend this status to other key ports in the Far East. The Far East ports, the Northern Sea Route, and modernisation of our mainline railways will all contribute to greater integration with the Asia-Pacific region and create an important infrastructure link between the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. APEC economies are showing real interest too in Russiaâs proposals to form a common education space in the region. Today, when the Asia-Pacific region has established itself ever more solidly as part of the worldâs leading technology centres, it is more relevant than ever to combine our efforts to create big research platforms and centres. Recognising Russiaâs sense of initiative in this area, our partners have entrusted our country, together with Peru, the right to preside over the APEC Education Ministerial Meeting, which will take place in Lima in 2016. Rapid economic growth is not possible without guaranteed energy security in the APEC region and fair and long-term climate regulation. Russia supports APECâs efforts to establish good conditions for investing in the regional energy transport system, develop integrated energy markets, increase the share of eco-friendly and renewable energy sources, and ensure access to low-carbon technologies. The Paris Climate Change Conference will take place soon, in December. This conference will try to reach a global agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Russia wants to see this work succeed and we have already presented our report on our countryâs contribution to these efforts. The scale and diversity of APECâs tasks is very impressive. I believe that we will be successful in resolving these tasks if we keep to the fundamental principles of working together as partners and acting in the interests of our peoples and our efforts to create a united Asia-Pacific family.

The task becomes even more imperative within the context of a general economic malaise and perceived slowdown, amid efforts to further open up the world economic system. MORE COOPERATION NEEDED IN G20 FOR GROWTH In its latest Economic Outlook, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) cut its forecasts for global economic growth to 2.9 percent for this year and 3.3 percent for 2016. Also, the OECD pointed to a ""dramatic slowdown in global trade growth,"" which is projected to be just 2 percent this year, down from the 3.4 percent posted in 2014. A World Trade Organization (WTO) report issued on Nov. 2 said the stockpile of trade-restrictive measures by G20 economies continues to grow, despite their ""relative restraint"" in introducing new trade restrictions. ""The WTO's system of trade rules helped to prevent a major protectionist response in the wake of the financial crisis -- but the number of trade-restrictive measures that have been introduced remains a cause for concern,"" said WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo. ""The G20 should show leadership by eliminating existing trade restrictions."" Experts are also calling for more robust cooperation among G20 economies to speed up world economic growth. ""The G20's core mandate is about strong, sustainable and balanced growth, and more and better cooperation is needed than what is being signaled ahead of this meeting,"" said Tristram Sainsbury, a research fellow in the G20 Studies Center at the Lowy Institute. ""The international economic outlook has worsened to the point where the world economy teeters on the edge of global recession."" Before joining the Lowy Institute, Sainsbury was at the Australian Treasury, where he worked on G20 policy and focused mainly on international financial architecture reform, financial regulation reform and G20 growth strategies. On the much-reported U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal, Sainsbury said Washington may eventually find that its commercial interests are better served by opening access to the TPP (and TTIP and TiSA) on equal terms to China and other key emerging markets. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is a proposed free trade agreement between the European Unionand the United States, while the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) is being negotiated by 23 WTO members. In the face of a trading system dominated by global value chains and goods that are ""made in the world,"" Sainsbury said, ""a comprehensive agreement that more closely resembles a multilateral trade agreement carries more economic benefits as it lessens the risk of trade diversion."" Ussal Sahbaz, an analyst at the Economic Policy Research Foundation of Turkey, also called for efforts to strengthen the role of the WTO. ""The global economy faces serious problems that need coordinated action,"" Sahbaz said. ""One of them is the fall in the growth of trade, which used to grow much faster than the world economy, before the 2008 (global financial) crisis."" ""Now the growth of trade fell below the growth of the world economy. One possible reason is the increasing number of bilateral and regional trade agreements, instead of multilateralism in the global trade regime,"" he said. ""Another reason is increasing non-tariff barriers to trade. The WTO approved the trade facilitation agreement, but it has not been ratified by enough number of governments yet. Only five G20 countries have ratified the agreement,"" Sahbaz said. ""The G20 has to work toward restoring the growth of global trade to its prior capacity."" ""Promoting free trade requires more doing than talking,"" he said. CHINA'S EFFORTS TO BRIDGE INFRASTRUCTURE GAP, INEQUALITY The other two problems hampering world economic recovery are the growing global infrastructure gap and rising inequalities in the world, Sahbaz said. ""It is estimated that the growing global economy will need 15 trillion U.S. dollars of infrastructure investment in the next 15 years. This is twice the current investment levels -- something that the existing public spending is not enough,"" Sahbaz said. ""The world will need more international financial institutions that engages in the infrastructure investment -- like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) -- and more private investment,"" he said. Sahbaz attributed the widening gap between the rich and the poor, particularly in the advanced and developing countries, partly to technological transformation, which makes erstwhile routine jobs irrelevant and leads to youth unemployment reaching levels that threaten social stability. ""The world has to provide coordinated solutions to the global skills transformation problem,"" he said. Some G20 leaders, before heading for the Antalya summit, also pledged efforts to work for a stronger, open global economy. Development is meaningful only when it is inclusive and sustainable, and to achieve such development requires openness, mutual assistance and win-win cooperation, Chinese President Xi Jinpingsaid in September at the United Nations. At a press briefing about Xi's attendance at the Antalya summit, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Li Baodong said that China will work with all member countries to realize the goals of leading a new round of global economic growth, pushing forward the transition of the G20 from a mechanism of emergency response to one of long-term governance, building and maintaining an open economy, and adopting a responsible macroeconomic policy. The Belt and Road Initiative, which was put forward by Xi and comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, and the AIIB, which was also proposed by China, have been hailed as examples of inclusiveness and openness in international economic cooperation. Sahbaz, the Turkish analyst, highlighted the benefits of the Belt and Road Initiative for world economic cooperation. ""There are now large capital reserves in developing countries like China, India and Turkey. We also have a great amount of know-how and can organize large business ventures. But we have not yet used these resources to integrate large parts of the developing world,"" said Sahbaz. ""The Belt and Road Initiative aims to mobilize these resources to modernize the vast region of Eurasia,"" he said. ""Think of the distance between the Pacific and the Balkans. Large parts of that region still needs roads, banking systems, fiber optic cables to join the standards of living in the developed world. In that sense, the Belt and Road Initiative is the natural continuation of the equalizing trend we have seen in the post-WWII era,"" he added.

In that sense, the Belt and Road Initiative is the natural continuation of the equalizing trend we have seen in the post-WWII era,"" he added."

Following the vote, Robb acknowledged the support of the opposition, which he said continued Australia's long-standing tradition of bipartisan support for freer trade. ChAFTA was previously objected by the opposition, which had expressed concerns over visa regulations surrounding foreign projects. Labor had said by bringing in cheaper workers from China, large companies could pay them significantly less than the Australian standard. The government and the opposition struck a deal on October 21 on the changes to Australia's legislation, which will ensure that Australian workers are offered work first, and any workers coming in from China must be licensed and fairly paid as not to undermine Australian pay, conditions and standards. This deal leads to a bi-partisan support of the China-Australia trade deal. Shadow Trade Minister Penny Wong said on Monday at the Senate that the legislation required in order for ChAFTA to be approved in Australia would simultaneously protect Australian workers and conditions, while also ""delivering jobs"" and scope for businesses to grow in the future. ChAFTA will also result in the removal of a number of tariffs, such as those on Australian beef, dairy and wine coming into China, while Australians will have access to cheaper Chinese goods, such as electricals and homewares. ""The agreement will enter into force when Australia and China have both completed their domestic treaty, making processes, and we're working with China for this to happen as soon as possible,"" Robb said."

(Xinhua/Huang Jingwen) SEOUL, Oct. 31 -- China and the Republic of Korea (ROK) on Saturday pledged to deepen their pragmatic cooperation in various areas ranging from innovation to manufacturing, cementing the strategic cooperative partnership between the East Asian neighbors. The agreement came as Chinese Premier Li Keqiangmet with the ROK President Park Geun-hye after starting his three-day ROK visit, which will also see him attending the trilateral summit between China, Japanand the ROK. Li told Park that the development of the China-ROK relations has maintained desirable momentum, bringing benefits to the two peoples and the regional stability and prosperity. A total of 17 bilateral business contracts and governmental accords in areas including trade and economy, science and technology, environmental protection and people-to-people exchanges, were signed at the witness of Li and Park after their talks. In his five-pronged proposal for closer ties, Li called on the two nations to build up synergies between their own development strategies so as to create new highlights in their already-close cooperation. Li said that efforts should be paid to synergize and integrate China's Belt and Road initiative and the ROK's Eurasia Initiative, China's mass entrepreneurship and innovation and the ROK's strategy for a ""creative economy,"" the ""Made in China 2025"" initiative and the ROK's ""3.0 strategy for manufacturing innovation"", as well as the two nations' efforts to explore third-party markets in the production capacity cooperation. ""We should seize the opportunities of such synergy and strengthen our cooperation in innovation, intelligent manufacturing and development and research of high-end technology,"" Li said. ""They will boost the transformation and upgrading of our economies, promote regional inter-connectivity and bring us mutual benefits and common development,"" he added. He also called on China and the ROK to deepen their strategic cooperative partnership and enhance high-level exchanges and dialogues on different levels. Since last year, Beijing and Seoul have worked on upgrading their ties toward a partnership for joint development, regional peace, Asian revitalization and world prosperity. China now stands as the ROK's largest trading partner and largest source of import while ROK is China's third most important trading partner. Their trade volume is expected to reach 300 billion U.S. dollars this year, a 60-fold increase over the past 20-plus years. In the meeting, Li urged the two nations to launch maritime demarcation talks as soon as possible and strengthen cooperation in areas including coping with non-traditional security threats, law enforcement and disaster relief. The premier also called on China and the ROK to build platforms for the cooperation in innovation and entrepreneurship for the youths and in jointly exploring the third-party markets. Commenting on the East Asia integrity, Li urged efforts to facilitate negotiations of the China-Japan-ROK trilateral free trade zone (FTZ) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to better connect the region. The three big economies in East Asia started the FTA negotiations in November 2012, discussing commodity trade, services and investment. The next round of such negotiations which is scheduled at the end of this year might include talks on commodity tariff reduction and services market access. Li urged China and the ROK to deepen their people-to-people exchanges to consolidate public support for bilateral ties. China and the ROK are each other's largest source country of overseas students and overseas travel destinations. Last year, the bilateral personnel exchanges between them surpassed 10 million. Talking about the scenario on the Korean Peninsula, Li said that China is devoted to maintaining peace and stability and realizing the denuclearization on the peninsula. He said that problems should be solved through negations. He added that China firmly supports the efforts of the ROK and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to improve bilateral relations and promote reconciliation. On her part, Park said that the close communication between leaders of the two countries is conducive to the development of bilateral ties as well as the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and the Northeast Asia as a whole. She agreed to Li's proposal to synergize the two countries' development strategies and said the ROK stands ready to strengthen cooperation with China in areas including trade, economy, finance, innovation, manufacturing and medical care, adding that her country is also willing to conduct production capacity cooperation with China in third-party countries. She said she hopes the ratifying process of the China-ROK FTA can be fast-tracked and become effective at an early date. Park added that the ROK side attaches great attention to China's important role in pushing forward the denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula and maintaining the regional peace and stability. She pledged that the ROK will continue to strengthen communication and coordination with China on the issue."

The appeal by Wu Jinglian comes as a top leadership meeting is scheduled to be held on Monday to map out the nation's development program for the next five years. The Communist Party of China is holding its Central Committee plenum from Monday to Thursday to come up with a proposal for the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20). The meeting will also fill high-level vacancies left by officials now facing graft charges, including 11 former Central Committee members and alternate members. Wu, 85, is a researcher at the State Council Development Research Center and a veteran economic adviser to the central government from the early days of the nation's economic reform. Speaking on Sunday at a Center for Industrial Development and Environmental Governance forum at Tsinghua University, Wu blamed what he called ""institutional barriers"" as the main factor for the slowdown in China's overall rise in productivity and the failure to meet the demands of its newly rich middle-class citizens. The only solution is to forge ahead with reform, rather than to introduce continual financial stimulus measures, he said. He criticized the attempt to use such measures to increase the speed of growth as being the wrong way to ease the nation's economic woes. In some key areas, reforms to remove institutional barriers have been slower than they should be, despite the leadership's strong determination expressed in reform programs adopted since 2012, he said. One of the areas is reform of the capital market and its supervision. Another, where many problems remain, is the government's fiscal management, ""because too much debt was incurred from the government's financial stimulus programs after the 2008 global financial crisis,"" Wu said. The effect of financial stimulus measures has fallen to such an extent as to be nearly useless now, as it has incurred huge debt for local governments and companies. Introducing more such measures for the economy is a wrong and unsustainable solution for China, Wu said. Instead, he said it should concentrate on reforming the financial system, fiscal management, prices and pricing system, State-owned enterprises, building up tariff-free zones and further opening up to global investors. Chen Qinghai, former dean of Tsinghua University's School of Economics and Management, said at the same forum that China's environmental challenge will be huge. Last week, Ma Jun, chief economist at the People's Bank of China, said future financial reform will focus on general finance, innovation finance, Internet finance and environmental or green finance."

Zhang's visit came at a time when the two countries are celebrating the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations and when Singapore becomes coordinator for the ASEAN-China Dialogue. Over the past 25 years, bilateral cooperation has generated significant results in a wide range of areas such as economy and trade, finance, science and technology, education, environmental protection, personnel training and social governance. The cooperation, in line with the strategic interests of the two countries and the development trend of ties between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), has made great contributions to the development of both the China-Singapore and the China-ASEAN relations. Now China and Singapore are facing new opportunities for cooperation while exploring new areas for cooperation. First, a third inter-governmental cooperative program is expected to become a flagship project in the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road initiative. The ""Belt and Road"" initiative was put forward by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 to promote connectivity, cooperation and common prosperity along the ancient land and maritime Silk Road trade routes. The third cooperative project, expected to be located in the west of China, has great significance for the less developed region as it will promote the economic development and lower the costs for investment and businesses there. In fact, this project builds on a sound basis for bilateral cooperation laid by the previous two cooperative projects -- the Suzhou Industrial Park and Tianjin Ecocity. Established in East China's Jiangsu Province in 1994, the 278-square km Suzhou Industrial Park, the largest cooperative project between China and Singapore, has become a paradigm for bilateral cooperation. The park has so far attracted 26.7 billion U.S. dollars of foreign investment into 5,200 programs. More than 90 of the Fortune top 500 enterprises have invested in the park. Meanwhile, Tianjin Ecocity, located in North China's port city of Tianjin and inaugurated in 2008, is expected to become a model for sustainable development. By 2017, all infrastructure facilities and environmental programs will be complete, with a view to a population of 350,000. Second, the free trade agreement between China and Singapore, as a pioneer for the China-ASEAN free trade area, is important for the development of the whole region. China and Singapore are expected to accelerate negotiations on upgrading their bilateral free trade agreement signed in October 2008. Negotiations could touch upon tariff reduction and exemption as well as expanding traditional areas for cooperation to service trade and finance. Besides, as China is conducting cooperation on production capacity with developing countries including ASEAN countries, Singapore, an international financial and commercial center with unique advantages in geography, finance and services, can participate in the process in the form of trilateral or multilateral cooperation to promote the common development of the region. With great potentials, it is believed that China and Singapore will further consolidate their comprehensive cooperation, setting an example for China-ASEAN cooperation."

The following are several things about the deal you need to know. Q: What is TPP? A: The free trade agreement was originally initiated by Chile, Singapore, New Zealand and Brunei in 2005, featuring elimination of tariffs among member economies. In 2008, with the participation of the United States, the TPP has gained more focus and later received application from Australia, Peru, Vietnam and Japan. The agreement involves 12 countries: U.S., Japan, Australia, Canada, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, New Zealand, Chile, Mexico and Peru, encompassing 40 percent of the world economy. The pact covers a range of legal provisions, including investment, service, electronic commerce, government procurement, intellectual property and environment. Market access to agricultural products, the country-of-origin rule in auto manufacturing industry, and intellectual property protection in pharmaceutical industry have been monumental sticking points throughout the entire negotiations. The agreement will allow great market exposure, as up to 18,000 kinds of tariff are to be reduced or eliminated under the terms of the TPP. Trade ministers of the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries attend a press conference after negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement in Atlanta, the United States, on Oct. 5, 2015. (Xinhua/Gao Pan) Q: What are the main features of the TPP? A: One of the main features of the TPP is setting up standards and rules and reshaping the trade rules in Asia-Pacific and the world with ""full coverage"" and ""high standard."" In terms of ""full coverage,"" the TPP includes many more fields than most free trade treaties, such as investment and competition policy, technical trade barrier, food safety, intellectual property rights, green growth and labor protection. The TPP also features ""high standard"" in terms of openness, for example in environmental protection and government purchase. Experts said the high standard represents the trend of international trade, but also surpassed the ability and condition of some developing members. Q: What challenges remain after the TPP deal was reached? A: The first challenge is the deal still need to be ratified by 12 member states, which faces difficult political wrestle in each countries. For example, in the United States, several Republican and Democratic presidential candidates have begun attacking the TPP, raising concerns about potential job losses in the United States. Meanwhile, trade unions, environmental groups, consumer and heath care organizations across the U.S. have come together to organize protests against the TPP out of various concerns. As U.S. President Barack Obama has to notify Congress at least 90 days before he can sign the TPP agreement, it still has a long way to go before the deal reaches Congress for possible ratification. The earliest date for a final TPP vote in U.S. Congress would be in February 2016. The second challenge is that the TPP could create new imbalance and uncertainty between developed and developing member states. Some experts have voiced concerns that the TPP, demanding to reduce trade protection, investment regulation and promote financial liberalization, will not be in conformity with the development stage of many emerging economies, and even put companies in developed countries at risk. Joseph Stiglitz, the famed Nobel Prize-winning economist, slammed the Peruvian negotiation tactics, describing them as ""capitulating to the demands of developed countries."" He said the TPP, if signed in its current form, would see ""the theft of genetic material from the Peruvian Amazon ...to benefit big pharmaceutical companies and drive up the costs of generics."" File photo taken on Dec. 7, 2013 shows the port of Singapore. The TPP Ministers meet in Singapore from Dec. 7 to 10 for advanced stage negotiations. (Xinhua/Then Chih Wey) Q: How will TPP affect China? A: China sees the TPP as one of the key free trade agreements for the Asia-Pacific region and is open to any mechanism that follows rules of the World Trade Organization and can boost the economic integration of the Asia-Pacific, said its Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday. China hopes the TPP pact and other free trade arrangements in the region can boost each other and contribute to the Asia-Pacific's trade, investment and economic growth, said the ministry. China has not ruled out joining the TPP at a proper time. The deal might bring certain impact to China's export in the short term, however, within the context of the globalization, no multilateral trade mechanism could exclude exterior countries and regions from international trade system in the long run. China has developed a deep-level, high standard and all-dimensional overseas trade structure, as it has signed free trade agreements with Switzerland, South Korea and Australia, with advancing talks on a China-U.S. and China-Europe investment treaty, Shanghai free trade zone, regional comprehensive economic partnership and various economic cooperative arrangements. Some experts have pointed out the the TPP will have a limited impact on China."

Zhengzhou is one of the pilot cities for import e-commerce in China. [Photo/Xinhua] Every afternoon, Cao Fuchun goes to a nearby express delivery station to see if any parcels have arrived for him. The retired worker has caught the ""overseas"" bug. For Cao, buying goods online from overseas means he can shop in countries he has never been to. Living in Pengzhou county near Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan province, Cao has bought skimmed milk from Australia, beef from Argentina and a water filter from Germany, among other goods. At the end of last year, Cao's daughter, an accountant in Beijing, bought US-made fish oil capsules and vitamin tablets for her parents. ""I was surprised how inexpensive they were, so I got hooked on buying overseas,"" he says. A growing number of Chinese online shoppers are buying globally. Most are young, well educated and eager to buy foreign goods that are unavailable or exorbitantly priced in China. They are a booming multi-billion-dollar market for foreign e-retailers and producers. According to the China E-commerce Research Center, China's total cross-border e-commerceï¼inbound and outboundï¼reached 4.2 trillion yuan ($657 billion) in 2014, and will grow to 5.5 trillion yuan in 2015. The Ministry of Commerce forecasts cross-border e-commerce will be worth 6.5 trillion yuan in 2016, accounting for 20 percent of the country's total foreign trade. Nielsen's Global E-commerce and The New Retail Survey in April said several factors are at play to boost China's e-commerce. Rapid urbanization and high population density make the home delivery model economically viable, particularly when coupled with low labor costs. In addition, booming smartphone ownership and usage have created huge mobile commerce opportunities. China's domestic e-commerce sector is gaining its share of the market, too. According to China's Customs service and China E-commerce Research Center, 18 million Chinese spent 140 billion yuan buying from overseas in 2014, and that is expected to reach 1 trillion yuan in 2018. The government is backing this trend. In August 2013, the State Council issued a policy to support cross-border e-commerce, with six concrete measures to facilitate processes, including Customs clearance, quarantine inspection, duties and foreign exchange. In 2014, seven citiesï¼Shanghai, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Zhengzhou, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Chongqingï¼were designated import e-commerce pilot zones, where foreign goods can be stored in bonded warehouses before Customs clearance. In 2015, another two coastal cities were added to the list. According to tax regulations in those cities, each order under 500 yuan is duty-free, and each order from 500 to 1,000 yuan incurs a 10-percent tariff, compared with ordinary imported goods being taxed around 40 percent on average."

Trade ministers of the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries ""have successfully concluded"" the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade talks, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said Monday. [Photo/Xinhua] The Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday said China welcomes the agreement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade pact and hopes it can facilitate talks on other regional free trade deals to push economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region. The comments came after the trade ministers of the United States and 11 other countries in the Pacific Rim reached an agreement on the TPP in Atlanta on Monday, even though the final ratification of this ambitious deal in the member nations is far from certain. After more than five years of negotiations, the agreement was signed by Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the US and Vietnam, which together account for 40 percent of the world economy. The ministry's spokesperson said this agreement is one of the most important free trade deals in the Asia-Pacific region, and China takes an open attitude toward efforts and actions that promote regional economic integration and system development in the Asia-Pacific region under the rules of the World Trade Organization. Zhou Shijian, a senior researcher on trade relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said the process for all participants to gain the approval of their legislative bodies back home will take months or even longer, and approval for the deal is not certain as it will confront various challenges stemming from other political factors. Canadian trade officials, for instance, were under pressure to get an agreement before the federal election in that country on Oct 19. But while Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper is a strong supporter of the TPP, his prospects in the election remain unclear. Tom Mulcair, the leader of Canada's New Democrat Party, which until recently was leading the polls, said on Friday that if he wins his government will not be bound by any TPP deal signed by Harper. Meanwhile, there were protests against the TPP outside the venue in Atlanta where the TPP negotiations were being held, and the agreement still has a long way to go before it reaches the US Congress for possible ratification. Several Republican and Democratic presidential candidates have already begun attacking the deal. There are still differences to be ironed out as well, Australia is keen for other member countries to grant more favorable tariff rates or zero tariff treatment for its agricultural products, and Japan demands other members further lower their tariff charges on its auto parts and vehicles, both of which to a certain extent would hurt other members' interests. The content of the TPP talks mainly covered intellectual property protection, cross-border e-commerce, investment, the service trade, government procurement, labor treatment, environment and tariff reductions. Zhao Zhongxiu, a trade professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said the TPP is dominated by the US currency and its financial policies, and it would to a certain extent consolidate the position of the dollar as the dominant global currency through trade between its members. ""Under such circumstances, the financial resources of the 12 TPP members will be integrated and indirectly controlled by the US. This is something that will hurt China's efforts to boost exports and promote the use of its currency globally,"" Zhao said. Gao Hucheng, China's commerce minister, said earlier this year that the country will continue to study and assess the impact of the TPP and the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the US and European Union, and will pursue its own free trade strategies.

In reality, the ancient trade route between East Asia and Europe is reviving along with roaring freight trains and trucks, more than a millennium after it faded into obscurity due to frequent wars and the rise of sea transportation. Located in China's far west but in the middle of the Silk Road, Xinjiang is ready to embrace the revival as China launched the Silk Road Economic Belt initiative two years ago with aims to boost infrastructure and trade between China, Central Asia and Europe. Yawuz Selim, a 38-year-old Turkish businessman, is one of many who are finding their fortune in Xinjiang. Selim realized that Turkey's products were very popular in Xinjiang during his first visit to the regional capital of Urumqi in 2012. He set up a children's clothing store in the city the next year after he quit the job as an accountant in Istanbul. ""I hope to bring top quality Turkish dresses to Xinjiang and expand my business eastward, where there is more purchasing power,"" he said. PIVOT OF NEW SILK ROAD When a Han Dynasty emperor sent his envoy Zhang Qian on a diplomatic mission to Central Asia more than 2,000 years ago, he set in motion an economic miracle. The Silk Road evokes a resplendent past of trade uniting the people and cultures as Asia and Europe. Now, China is pursuing an ambitious plan to revive these trading links with its neighbors, extending all the way to the eastern Mediterranean. As the bridgehead, Xinjiang plays an important role, thanks to its geopolitical,cultural and resource advantages. With cargo trains now linking Chinese cities with Europe, trade volume at northwest Xinjiang's Alataw Pass on the Kazakhstan border reached 25 million tonnes last year, after an average growth of 27 percent since 1991. South Xinjiang's largest city of Kashgar, center of the Uygur civilization and once an important staging post along the Silk Road, continues to attract tourists with its architecture, mosques and craftsmen. At the same time, impressive buildings are rising to the east of the old town. Eighteen high-rises, including two 58-storey skyscrapers, are planned by the Kashgar government. Expectations are high in Kashgar. Projects such as the China-Pakistan and China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railways, though still in the discussion phase, have excited government officials and local people alike. Already with direct flights to Islamabad, there are plans for scheduled flights to central Asia and Turkey. The city has never concealed its intention to emulate the success of Shenzhen in south China, which took the lead in assisting Kashgar's development because of a pairing program. In 2010, the slogan ""Shenzhen in the east, Kashgar in the west"" became emblematic of the city's new status as an special economic zone. Just as Shenzhen's success relies heavily on neighboring Hong Kong, Kashgar plans to work closely with its own neighbors: Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan. A tariff-free zone to the north of Kashgar Airport opened in April. At a workshop in the zone, hundreds of local Uygur men and women assemble data cables and mobile phone chargers. An eye-catching billboard hangs on the wall of the Zhanbo Electronics Co. Ltd, a subsidiary of Guangdong-based Sike Electronics Company. It reads ""train 10,000 youths, employ them and help 10,000 households out of poverty."" The company currently exports 30 percent of its products to India and Pakistan. Xiong Fengling, chief financial officer of the company, said, ""We come here for the geographic advantages."" ""The Silk Road is awakened after a long period of slumber,"" said Gabriella Bonino, 62, an Italian who arrived in Kashgar after months of travel along the Silk Road. ""Townships along the route have become big cities,"" said Bonino, who is writing a book about the new Silk Road, is much different from that described by her countryman Marco Polo some 700 year ago. REGIONAL AUTONOMY Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, with a population of 22 million from 47 ethnic groups, will celebrate its 60th anniversary on Thursday. A system of ethnic regional autonomy was established in Xinjiang when it was founded on Oct. 1, 1955. All ethnic groups enjoy the right to vote, education, use their own language and inherit their traditions, as well as the right of equal participation in state affairs and the right to religious belief. In 2014, the 550 deputies to the 12th People's Congress of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the local legislature, came from 14 ethnic groups, with 66 percent from ethnic minorities themselves, according to a white paper issued by the State Council Information Office last Thursday. In 1955, the number of ethnic minority officials in Xinjiang was 46,000, which increased to 417,000 in 2014, accounting for 51.4 percent of the total officials in the region. The incumbent head of the regional government is Shohrat Zakir, a 62-year-old Uygur man. Marked improvement has been observed in Xinjiang's overall strength. Its gross regional product reached 927 billion yuan (146 billion U.S. dollars)in 2014, a 116-fold increase over that of 1955 in real terms, with an annual growth rate of 8.3 percent, 0.2 percentage points higher than China's average during the same period. Experience has proved that the combination of centralized national leadership with ethnic regional autonomy, and the combination of ethnic factors with regional ones fully accord with the prevailing situation in China and with the realities and needs of Xinjiang. PURSUIT OF LONG-TERM STABILITY Though Xinjiang has developed rapidly in the past decade, terrorism in the name of ""jihad"" has increased since 2009. Terrorism,together with unemployment, are the biggest threats to the region. At the second central work conference on Xinjiang in May 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for ""nets spread from the earth to the sky"" to defend against terrorists, stressing long-term stability as the main goal for the region. The infiltration of Islamic fundamentalism and extremism into Xinjiang, a region with more than half of its population Muslim, threatens the region's stability and economic and social development. South Xinjiang's Hotan, Kashgar and Aksu are areas overseas separatist forces have penetrated, where the majority of the population are Muslim Uygur. More Uygur women have been observed wearing black Islamic robes instead of their traditional colorful Uygur costumes in recent years. To fend off religious extremism, the regional government started a three-year program in March 2014 sending 200,000 cadres from urban government departments, public institutions and state-owned enterprises to live and work for a year in 12,000 villages, state farms and communities. ""Young men with little education do not know much about Islam, nor have they read the Quran,"" said Ablajan Abduwakhi, Dean of the Mathematics and Science, Kashgar University, working in a village in Kashgar prefecture since March this year.""They are easily hoodwinked by extremists."" Cadres from Kashgar University organized a month of evening classes for villagers, mostly in their 20s and 30s, teaching them about Uygur culture, Islam, government policy and provided vocational training. The vocational training, including embroidery, cooking and masonry, has helped many villagers become self-employed and move away from religious extremism, said Ablajan. ""You only receive real respect through hard work,"" said Amyna Yason, 45, an embroidery student."

(Xinhua/Zhang Duo) NANNING, Sept. 18 -- Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli said Friday that China and ASEAN members should make joint efforts to finish the negotiations on upgrading the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area (CAFTA) by the end of this year. He made the remarks while addressing the 12th China-ASEAN Expo, which started on Friday in Nanning, capital of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Zhang called to boost cooperation in customs, inspection and quarantine, certification, and information collection between China and ASEAN to lower non-tariff barriers and make bilateral trade and investment easier. ""We should explore new growth source of trade and expand mutual trade and investment,"" he said. China aims to elevate bilateral trade with ASEAN to 1 trillion U.S. dollars by 2020 and invest over 100 billion U.S. dollars in ASEAN between 2013 and 2020, according to the vice premier. ""China is willing to work with ASEAN to accelerate the negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and boost the regional economic integration,""Zhang added.

""This cooperation is not only out of good will, but also on the fundamental interest of both countries and their shared responsibilities to the world,"" Cui said in the article titled ""China and America: Stay Focused on What Really Matters"". Cui cited the landmark expansion of the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) in July this year, the first major tariff-eliminating deal at the World Trade Organization in almost two decades. Because of this deal, about 1.3 trillion U.S. dollars worth of IT trade will be conducted with zero tariff rate per year, benefiting numerous businesses, workers and consumers worldwide. ""This deal would not have been possible without a critical agreement between China and the United States last November and close coordination and cooperation between the two sides,"" he wrote. What really matters to China and the U.S., the world's two most important trading countries and the second-largest trading partner for each other, is not who has the privilege to write trade rules, but how to write rules together with other countries in a bid to jointly promote open, transparent and rule-based economic cooperation that benefits all. ""Certainly a lot more can be done down the road,"" said the ambassador. According to the Chinese envoy, tackling climate change is a priority for both China and the United States. Both have made bold commitments of cutting carbon emissions and are determined to promote comprehensive and balanced outcomes in the 2015 Climate Change Conference in Paris. Both believe that reducing carbon emissions will not impede economic growth but generate more jobs and opportunities, and bring more practical cooperation between them. The U.S. demand for solar panels and wind turbines is rising rapidly, and Chinese companies can provide high-quality and economical products to meet that demand. China is also looking to build more nuclear power plants, apply more clean-coal technology and increase the exploration and consumption of natural gas. American products and expertise are surely welcomed. In order for this to happen, Cui said, the United States should lift outdated restrictions on the export of high-tech energy products and avoid implementing unbalanced trade remedy actions against Chinese products. On the recent breakthrough in the Iranian nuclear negotiations, the envoy said, it would not have been possible without effective China-U.S. cooperation and the steadfast commitment of both sides to safeguarding the international nonproliferation regime. Over the years, he explained, China has observed every UN Security Council resolution with regard to Iran and played a unique and constructive role in fostering diplomatic solutions. This proves that as long as there is a common goal, the different approaches employed by China and the United States can complement each other and produce win-win results. ""In Africa, there is no competition over who is a better partner of African countries. If China and the United States can work effectively together and contribute to the peace and prosperity of this continent, both will be better partners of African countries,"" said Cui. In the fight against Ebola last year, China launched the largest emergent humanitarian-assistance action in its history, and worked closely with the United States and other international partners. ""This set a great model of cooperation between our two countries, which can be applied to many other important areas,"" he wrote. Even on controversial issues, Cui said, cooperation instead of confrontation is key to finding solutions. The United States admits that it has no territorial claim in the South China Seaand basically shares the same goal as China -- keeping sea-lanes safe and open for business. ""We hope the United States will play a constructive role in creating a supportive atmosphere for the peaceful settlement of the disputes through negotiations by the countries directly involved,"" Cui noted. On cyber security, he said: ""China is a major victim of cyberattacks."" A large portion of such activities originate from foreign countries. Cyberattacks are usually conducted anonymously and across borders, making them hard to trace back to the source. ""Unfounded accusations or megaphone diplomacy will be nothing but counterproductive. If we work together rather than separately on these issues, there is certainly a lot more to achieve,"" wrote the ambassador. The Chinese Embassy is holding a photo exhibition of China-U.S. cooperation during World War II. It relives the profound friendship that China and the United States fostered in fighting fascists side-by-side more than seventy years ago. Seven decades is just a short span of time in human history. ""Vicissitudes in history do not stand in the way of closer cooperation between our two countries on major issues concerning the future and destiny of mankind. Such cooperation has become even more essential and necessary in the twenty-first century,"" he stressed. Looking ahead, the ambassador called for fostering good habits of cooperation between the two sides -- never lose focus, stick to shared goals and interests, accommodate each other's legitimate concerns, benefit from each other's wisdom, overcome obstacles that hold us back, and most importantly, prevent our differences from dominating the agenda of the bilateral relationship. As Chinese President Xi Jinpingwill pay his first state visit to the United States in September, Cui expressed the hope that ""his meetings with President Obama will give further guidance to the building of a new model of major country relations between our two great nations, and bring greater benefits to our two peoples."""

[Photo proided to China Daily] China is expanding trial reforms for the pricing of electricity into seven regions, as the country moves to turn energy price into more market-driven. Five provinces - Anhui, Hubei, Yunnan, Guizhou as well as Ningxia Hui autonomous region - will test the water for electricity transmission and distribution price reform, following pilots in Shenzhen and Inner Mongolia autonomous region, said the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in a statement on Monday. The NDRC will push forward electricity tariff reform and continue to expand test regions, it added. Such reform is expected to change the financial model of power grids, as their current profits come from the guaranteed difference between on-grid and retail tariffs. Instead, power generation enterprises will apply for an electricity sales license and likely to bid openly for contracts, reported China Business News citing industry insiders. A power transaction market will be established for better resources allocation, where diversified entities can participate and drive down power generation costs, said experts."

""The number of trade conflicts between our two countries decreased significantly since disputes over solar panels were solved via negotiations in 2013,"" said Duan Wei, the Executive Director of CHKD, ""This trend reflected our bilateral consensus that trade protectionism in any form should be opposed."" According to him, trade and investment between China and Germany remained vibrant despite current turbulence over debt crisis in Europe and a weak global economy. One third of the total trade volume between China and Europe were contributed by trade with Germany. ""China and Germany complement each other in economy, there are close ties between us... Neither Chinese nor German enterprises could be immune to effects of bilateral trade conflicts,"" Duan said. He added that as traditional tools of trade protection like tariff and import quota became less and less available thanks to the trend of free trade around the globe, many countries turned to new protection measures such as anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties. Both China and Germany opposed European Commission's decision to impose punitive duties on imported Chinese solar panels in 2013, and helped settled disputes over telecommunication products in 2014. ""Chinese enterprises appreciate Germany's position on the issues,"" said Duan. Around 6,000 German companies are doing business in China, three times the number of Chinese firms running in Germany. Duan said China regarded Germany as an important partner in upgrading its industry, while Germany needed to cooperate with China to expand business in the world's biggest and fastest growing market. He added that Chinese enterprises' capability to protect themselves from trade conflicts strengthened in recent years. They were committed to obey laws and rules in foreign countries, but would not hesitate to protect their legal rights in potential disputes."

Beef and lamb exporters saw tariff savings of 161 million NZ dollars (107.99 million U.S. dollars) last year, and the amount was set to grow as tariffs continued to be cut and export volumes grew, according to Beef + Lamb New Zealand. The sector's export returns last year totaled 7.7 billion NZ dollars (5.16 billion U.S. dollars), with the amount in tariffs paid falling from 331 million NZ dollars (222.03 million U.S. dollars) in 2013 to 326 million NZ dollars (218.68 million U.S. dollars) last year. The decrease in tariffs paid and increase in tariffs saved was largely a result of the continued removal of tariffs negotiated as part of New Zealand's FTAs, particularly with China and Taiwan, Beef + Lamb chief executive Scott Champion said in a statement. ""As market access for our red meat products continues to improve as more FTAs come into force, and tariffs are further phased out within existing FTAs, those savings can only grow."" The increased tariff savings enabled New Zealand to remain competitive on the global market and gave exporters the flexibility to viably sell products into more markets."

US cosmetic giant Estee Lauder Companies will reduce the price of some of its most popular products in China from July 1, after the Chinese government lowered import tariffs to stimulate domestic consumption. ""By reducing prices, we hope that more consumers in China will now experience the quality and efficacy of our most iconic products together with our expert advice and high level of personal service,"" the company says in a statement. The price reduction will cover all skincare and make-up brands owned by the company, including Estee Lauder, Clinique, La Mer, Origins, MAC, Bobbi Brown and Lab Series. The reduction in price ranges from 11 percent on a best-selling La Mer facial cream to 23 percent on an Origins essence. Chinaâs Ministry of Finance announced that it will reduce import tariff by an average of 50 percent, on products such as apparel, shoes, cosmetics and diapers, effective June 1. The tariff on cosmetics will fall from 5 percent to 2 percent. In May, French cosmetic company the LâOreal Group announced that it will reduce the price of most of its imported products. ""Although the impact of tariff reduction on the retail price is very limited, we think the government's move is positive to the market. And our decision will further encourage consumption in China,"" the company said in a statement. The move is considered to be a countermeasure to the slowdown in the Chinese market, analysts say. China's luxury market declined slightly for the first time last year, as a result of economic slowdown, the government's crackdown on gifting and increasing overseas purchase. At the same time, the wide price gap of imported goods in China and Europe and the United States are driving a grey market of scalpers. ""The price reduction will strengthen the connection between the brands and the customers. It will help the brand to maintain their long-term value and might trigger more brands to follow suit,"" He Mu, founder and chairman of Shanghai-based consulting firm Wisdom Aid, tells China Daily. The move echoes Chanel's decision in March to cut the prices of three signature handbags in China while raising them in Europe.

According to a preliminary estimation conducted by the Australian Centre for International Economic Studies, the FTA will boost Australian GDP growth by 0.7 percentage point and China's GDP growth by 0.1 percentage point. The historic agreement was signed by Australia's Trade Minister Andrew Robb and China's Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng. The China-Australia free trade agreement (ChAFTA) will greatly reduce the threshold for bilateral trade and investment flows, and establish a more open, convenient and standardized institutional arrangement for future development of bilateral economic and trade relations.

It will further boost the two-way flow of funds, resources and personnel, promote deeper all-round bilateral economic and trade relations, enhance the level of cooperation, and provide important content to enrich the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries. The FTA provides a very high level of liberalization in goods. 96.8 percent of China's tariff lines will be liberalized, directly using the linear tariff reduction method. Tariff reduction will be complete on 95 percent of tariff lines within five years, and the time-frame for the remaining products will not exceed 15 years. Tariffs on all Australian products exported to China will be reduced, with 100 percent liberation. 91.6 percent of tariffs will be reduced to zero when the FTA comes into effect, 6.9 percent of lines will be tariff-free in the third year, and the remaining 1.5 percent will be free within five years.

The long-awaited formal agreement were signed by Australia's Trade Minister Andrew Robb and China's Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng Wednesday at a ceremony in Canberra. Economists have hailed the landmark decision as mutually beneficial, saying that both countries will be satisfied by the outcome. Peter Drysdale, Head of East Asian Bureau of Economic Research at the Australian National University told Xinhua in an interview that the red tape had been holding back export numbers from reaching their peaks, and he expects the free trade agreement to pay handsome dividends for the slowing economies of both nations. ""The signing of ChAFTA (China-Australia free trade agreement) is an important landmark in the relationship between the two countries,"" he said on Wednesday. ""What is does is opening up opportunities for change. Australia will become an even more important, low-cost supplier to China."" The FTA means that up to 85 percent of all Australian exports will enter China tariff-free. Within four years, the number will increase to 93 percent while, within a decade, more than 95 percent of goods will be without a charge. Tariffs on products such as beef, pork and dairy -- which are all up around the 20 percent mark -- will be slashed in coming years. Tariffs on alcohol, which in the case of spirits sits at an eye- watering 65 percent, will be also be removed within four years. James Laurenceson from the Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology in Sydney told Xinhua he expects trade between the two nations to increase dramatically once the tariffs are removed. ""Over the past year falling iron ore prices have meant that the value of trade between Australia and China has been reduced,"" he said on Wednesday. ""That said, China still remains Australia's biggest trading partner by a large margin. By reducing barriers to agriculture and services trade, ChAFTA will act to not only boost the overall value of trade between Australia and China but also make it broader-based."" ""In short, it sets up a deeper and more balanced trade relationship in the future."" Drysdale said that while the resource boom was over, the new free trade agreement could restore balance to import and export levels between the two countries. He also hailed the new agreement as a crucial step in connecting other Asian partners with trade. ""With ChAFTA done and the Trans-Pacific Partnership out of the way one way or another, energy can directed to regional cooperation in East Asia through Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in a way that buttresses the global multilateral trading system,"" he said. The RCEP is a proposed trade agreement between several smaller South East Asian nations and powerhouses that already have existing FTAs between them, such as China, Australia, Japan, South Korea and India. Drysdale said a closer connection between China and Australia could result in them working together in other sectors, not just trade. ""The agreement with Australia can provide a foundation for Australia and China to work together in the region beyond narrowly trade issues,"" he said. Laurenceson said the ChAFTA agreement would also increase investment opportunities for the Chinese in Australian property and land, for it does not affect the foreign investment regime. ""It's important to remember that all this does is bringing China into line with what Australia already offers a number of other countries, including the United States, New Zealand, Japan and S. Korea,"" he said. ""The investment relationship between Australia and China has tended to lag behind the trade relationship and ChAFTA will help to correct that imbalance."" China is already Australia's biggest trading partner, making up 23.8 percent of the country's total trade value. In 2013-14, two-way trade between the two nations was measured at 123.7 billion U.S. dollars, but under the free trade agreement, that number is expected to rise."

The government implemented tax cuts on fourteen categories of imported consumer goods on Monday, an attempt to boost domestic consumption. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) announced China will cut import taxes on clothing, cosmetics and other goods from June 1. They slash duty by an average 50 percent on suits, fur garments and shoes. A tariff on cosmetics will fall to 2 percent from 5 percent, while a duty on diapers will decline to 2 percent from 7.5 percent. Following the MOF's announcement, global cosmetics giants L'Oreal and Estee Lauder both said that they would reduce the prices of imported products in the Chinese market. But finance and taxation experts point out that the tariff cuts may not always result in price drops, as import tax only takes up a very small share of product costs. Lin Jiang, a fiscal and taxation professor with Sun Yat-sen University, told Xinhua that imported goods in China are also subject to a 17 percent VAT as well as distribution costs, which usually overshadow the customs duty. ""Some products need to go through several layers of importers and wholesalers before they finally appear on the retail market,"" Lin said. ""In these cases, the policy dividend is more likely to be eaten up during the process."" Travelers from the Chinese mainland have demonstrated a strong purchasing power around the world. In 2014 alone, they spent an whopping 165 billion U.S. dollars abroad. Aside from shopping abroad, in department stores and boutiques, an increasing number of Chinese shoppers are turning to foreign e-commerce sites or purchasing agents for imported goods. Thanks to government support of trans-border e-commerce, consumer goods purchased via websites or agents abroad for personal use are only subject to a 10 percent tax on postal articles when they enter China. ""So despite the reduction on customs tariffs, trans-border e-commerce is still the cheapest way to buy foreign products, because there's no VAT and other costs,"" Lin explained. ""I don't think the tax cuts will have an obvious impact on the numerous purchasing agents in the short term."" Ai Li, a Chinese accountant living in Melbourne, Australia, is one of these part-time purchasing agents. She has paid little attention to the tariff adjustment. ""Basically I do all consumer goods sales here in Australia, based on customers' demand. The most popular products are baby formulas, health care products and organic food such as honey,"" she told Xinhua on WeChat, a popular instant messaging service she uses to contact her clients and friends in China. ""My customers and I don't need to worry about the tax problem. The industry is becoming more mature and I'm working with courier companies which can take care of the delivery and customs clearance at the same time with a reasonable service charge,"" she added. Ai said price is not the only reason that people like to buy things directly via foreign sites or agents, and that ""they also want more choices and reliable quality."" The policy triggered particular concerns across the mainland-Hong Kong border. Some worry that the steep cut in import tariffs may hit Hong Kong's retail sector. Hong Kong Department Stores and Commercial Staff General Union estimated that local pharmacies and cosmetic stores will be seriously affected, though long-term influence of tax cuts remains unclear. Another group that might be affected is the controversial parallel traders, who pay short visits to Hong Kong to snap up consumer goods and re-sell them on the mainland. Experts said lowering customs tax was one suggested solution to challenge parallel trading, which has had negative impacts on both sides. But a Hong Kong parallel trader surnamed Leung told Xinhua that the tax cuts would have little impact on them. ""Because the market is huge,"" Leung said with strong confidence. ""Chinese consumers will need a great amount of imported goods until they become more confident about the quality of domestic products."" Tariff reduction is not the only challenge for Hong Kong retailers. In the newly established Guangdong Free Trade Area (FTA), several bonded stores have been set up where people can have a look or even try on bonded samples, then place orders online and have the products delivered to their doorstep directly from abroad. Tempus Outlet in Qianhai bonded zone in Shenzhen is packed with customers during weekends. The shopkeeper, who declined to be named, told Xinhua the most popular products are baby formula and diapers, the same as Hong Kong supermarkets and pharmacies. ""Baby products are always in rigid demand,"" she said. Several shoppers agreed that it is much more convenient to go to local bonded stores than to Hong Kong. With transportation and time cost in account, price differences become almost negligible. ""Chinese consumers now have more options to buy imported goods, and intense competition will no doubt bring down prices,"" Lin Jiang said. ""I think that's the significance of the tax reduction - it will boost competition."""

The signing of the FTA represents a milestone in the cooperation between the two countries. Under the accord, after a transitional period, South Korea will eliminate tariffs on 92 percent of all products from China, while China will abolish tariffs on 91 percent of all imported South Korean goods. ã At the signing ceremony, Chinese Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng said: ""This China-South Korea FTA is a high level, comprehensive and balanced free trade agreement. It's the largest deal for China in terms of trade volume and it's a deal that covers the widest fields."" Yoon Sang-jick, his South Korean counterpart, said that The FTA will make the economic ties between South Korea and China closer. It will provide enormous opportunities for future development of business from both countries and our respective economies. What outstanding features does this FTA have? Wang Shouwen, Vice Minister of China's Ministry of Commerce explained to People's Daily: Firstly, China is the world biggest trading country and South Korea ranks seventh. The trade volume between the two countries was about 300 billion dollars in 2014, accounting for 29 percent of the total trade volume of APEC countries. Following the signing of the FTA and the transitional period, tariffs will be eliminated for over 90 percent commodities in bilateral trade. Secondly, the FTA between China and South Korean covers 17 fields, including, traded goods, e-commerce, competition policies, government procurement, intellectual property protection, and environmental protection. Thirdly, in traded goods, China liberalizes 91 percent of tariffs covering 85 percent of import value, while South Korea liberalizes 92 percent of tariffs and 91 percent of import value. In the fields of service and investment, China and South Korea have also reached a balance in give and take. ã Entrepreneurs and investors of both countries will be eligible for two-year residency and work permits in each other's country. According to Wang Shouwen, in bilateral trade, intermediate products account for 72 percent and capital goods account for 18 percent. After the signing of the FTA, 86 percent of the tariffs for intermediate products will be eliminated and 99 percent of the tariffs for capital goods will be eliminated, which will mean a sharp decline in business costs in both countries. ãã South Korea expects the bilateral FTA to raise its real GDP by 0.96 percentage points and create 53,800 new jobs in the next 10 years. It is forecast that the FTA will help South Korean companies to make inroads into the world's largest consumer market. ""We encourage companies to use the tariff cuts to send more Chinese exports to South Korea, including small home appliances, daily goods, and machinery. Those products will be warmly welcomed in South Korea. Other areas such as automobiles are not included in the deal. But we have made progress in the investment and service sectors,"" said Enna Park, counselor of Embassy of the Republic of Korea in China.

The Ministry of Finance (MOF) announced on Monday that China will cut import taxes on clothing, cosmetics and some other goods from June 1. The MOF said that it will slash duty by half, on average, on suits, fur garments and shoes. A tariff on cosmetics will fall to 2 percent from 5 percent, while a duty on diapers will decline to 2 percent from 7.5 percent. There is no doubt that the cuts will reduce fiscal revenue, said Shi, while declining to give an exact amount, but he did not expect revenue to decrease too much given that more imported goods mean more import tax revenue. With strong purchasing power, Chinese mainland travelers often buy goods as diverse as diapers and handbags abroad to avoid import and consumer taxes back home. Mainland tourists abroad spent 165 billion U.S. dollars in 2014, up from 129 billion U.S. dollars in 2013."

According to a recent announcement from the Department of Tariff, the Ministry of Finance, China will cut import tariff rates of partial daily consumer goods in the form of a tentative tariff rate. Experts said that the implementation of the policy was a good initiative. However, markets determine the level of consumption. National brands should identify their positioning, improve product quality, and shape brand images. Tariffs will be reduced on a number of imported consumer goods, including clothes, shoes and boots, cosmetics, paper diapers etc. The tariffs of all the items involved will be cut by more than 50 percent on average. Everything has its cause. Due to high import tariffs and a preference for foreign brands, Chinese people with increasing purchasing power are interested in buying goods overseas. According to partial statistics from Ministry of Commerce, the value of consumption abroad in 2014 exceeded one trillion yuan. âThe measure of reducing tariffs of consumer goods is a good beginning. However, the market needs a certain time to respond. On one hand, the number of tariffs to cut is limited; on the other hand, markets determine real consumption ability. It canât be too high at the beginning.â Zhao Ping, deputy director of the consumption and economy research department, the Ministry of Commerce explained to the media. She noted that national brands should take advantage of opportunities to improve their quality and brand image, which is actually the âcatfish effectâ. Imported products may not be so different from national products. However, the fashion value and influence of the brand images which imported products own are what the domestic enterprises should learn from.

Despite increasing operational costs and the limited impact customs duties have on retail prices, L'Oreal said in a statement on Wednesday that it would lower the prices of imported products. The MoF announced Monday that as of June 1, import duties on consumer goods would be reduced by an average of 50 percent. The duty on cosmetics will be reduced to 2 percent from 5 percent. Economic growth slid to 7 percent in the first quarter this year, down from 7.3 percent the previous quarter, and retail sales in April grew 10 percent from a year ago, slightly lower than the 10.2 percent posted in March, indicating more easing measures may be needed to prop up growth. L'Oreal China CEO Alexis Perakis-Valat said the company welcomed the tax reduction. Last year, L'Oreal earned 14.3 billion yuan (2.3 billion U.S. dollars) in China, registering growth of 7.7 percent. Yu Jian, the general manager of consumer knowledge firm Kantar Worldpanel China, said the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) market had encountered challenges and looking forward it would probably settle into a period of moderate growth. SPENDING AT HOME Chinese consumers last year spent about 165 billion U.S. dollars overseas. A surge in the number of outbound tourists and the yuan's appreciation against the euro and Japanese yen also helped drive overseas consumption up 28 percent from 2013. The shopping mania has been mainly attributed to the substantial difference between domestic and overseas prices. Premium goods can be up to 50 percent more expensive in China than abroad. Prices in China are inflated because of high import and consumption taxes on luxury goods and a tendency by foreign firms to set much higher prices in China.P As economic growth continues to dip, policy makers have identified boosting domestic consumption as the most viable way to spur an economy beset by industrial overcapacity and corporate debt. The cabinet justifies this shake up of consumer goods taxes by saying that increased imports of popular goods would help boost domestic consumption and benefit the job market. Zhao Ping, a leading researcher at the Ministry of Commerce, said that if shoppers spent one third of the money they splurged overseas in China, domestic consumption would grow by 1 to 2 percent. Other luxury brands are also poised to slash prices to revive their China sales, especially as they have suffered from the ongoing corruption crackdown. China's luxury market shrunk for the first time in 2014, down 1 percent from a year earlier, according to a report by Bain &Co. Chanel last year lowered the price of its handbags in China by over 20 percent. ""In the past, the Chinese bought luxury goods as gifts. Now they buy them for themselves. Only by lowering prices can we help luxury brands retain their market share,"" said a China market agent for foreign brands who requested anonymity. ""The tariff reduction will be the catalyst for a trend of price cuts,"" she said."

The Ministry of Finance said that it will slash duties by half, on average, on imports including suits, fur garments and shoes. A tariff on cosmetics will fall to 2 percent from 5 percent, while a duty on diapers will decline to 2 percent from 7.5 percent, according to the ministry. The tax cuts come as the mainland looks for ways to boost spending at home to drive the slowing economic growth. Mainland travelers have strong purchasing power. They often buy goods as diverse as diapers and handbags to avoid import and consumer taxes back home. Official data showed that mainland tourists traveling abroad spent 165 billion U.S. dollars in 2014, up from 129 billion U.S. dollars in 2013. Adjacent to the mainland, Hong Kong has traditionally been a tax-free shopping destination for mainland consumers. However, analysts said the tax cuts may hurt their willingness to shop in the city. Caroline Mak, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Retail Management Association, said, ""The tax cuts will reduce price gap between Hong Kong and the mainland, possibly slowing the flow of mainland shoppers."" Hong Kong has already been hurt as shoppers have traveled elsewhere, due to political protests, local resentment against the visiting crowds and the strength of the U.S. dollar, to which the Hong Kong dollar is pegged. Mainland tourists will not buy lots of daily necessities in Hong Kong as before, but it remains to be seen as for the move's long-term impact on Hong Kong's retail sales, according to Hong Kong Department Stores and Commercial Staff General Union. However, some analysts said the tax cuts will have limited impact on the region's retail industry, as Hong Kong products are deemed more credible by mainland consumers. ""Hong Kong remains attractive as a shopping mecca because malls here have a wide variety of goods and offer one-stop shopping services,"" Caroline Mak said. Still, buying cosmetics in Hong Kong will remain the better deal for mainland consumers even after the tax cuts. For example, a Shu uemeura 450ml cleansing oil costs 86 U.S. dollars in Hong Kong, but is priced at around 121 U.S. dollars in Beijing. ""Even if the tax is cut, there will be price gap between Hong Kong and Beijing, thus I think I'd still prefer shopping in Hong Kong,"" said a Beijing customer surnamed Li."

The three-point proposal is boosting Asia-Africa cooperation, expanding South-South cooperation and promoting South-North cooperation. Commenting on President Xi's proposal, Director of Independent Bureau for Humanitarian Issues (IBHI) Professor Saeed Chaudhry said the countries in both continents can get on the right path to solve their issues and for progress if they follow the three-point proposal by President Xi. ""I don't take Xi's speech as only a routine speech by a leader. Xi has prescribed a brief prescription for all the problems in the two continents of Asia and Africa, by urging them to adopt policy of cooperation,"" said Chaudhry. According to Chaudhry, Africa and Asia had been conquered, used and discarded by the West, but China gave a new hope and appeared as a beam of light in a dark tunnel for Africa especially, and they are adopting ""Look East"" policy because China takes risks of investment in Africa that has started a rapid progress in the region.

Rare earthsï¼a group of minerals that are crucial to the technology and defense industriesï¼as well as tungsten and molybdenum will be exempt from tariffs, and wrought aluminum products will also enjoy a zero rate, the statement said. The move, according to Du Shuaibing, an analyst at natural resources consultancy Baichuan Information, will reduce the prices of rare earths by 20 to 25 percent. ""Rare earth export volumes are expected to increase greatly, which will help producers digest inventories,"" said Du. The move also will also have an impact on international rare earth prices, because lower-priced exports from China will affect sales of rare earths produced in other countries and regions. The metals are used in products as varied as iPhones and wind turbines. In 2014, rare earth exports reached 28,000 metric tons, up 27.3 percent from a year earlier. The average export price was 83,000 yuan ($13,300) per metric ton, down 47.8 percent. But Du said that resource and environmental taxes on rare earth producers, which have caused production costs and therefore prices to rise, are still the primary concern in the market. It is also crucial to crack down on illegal mining and smuggling, factors that lead to an oversupply, Du said. China's six major rare earth groups, which dominate exports, are expected to complete most of the work necessary to integrate small mines and smelting companies by the end of 2015. China is the world's largest producer and exporter of the minerals, but the industry is beset by problems including illegal mining, smuggling and a lack of competitiveness due to weak research and development. The country raised tariffs and imposed strict output quotas in 2010 to not only protect its scarce resources, but also reduce the environmental impact of extraction. Importers in Japan, Europe and the United States complained that the move had breached trade rules. Shares in producers of rare earths surged on Thursday after the duty change was announced.

Patrick Maluki, a lecturer at the University of Nairobi's school of diplomacy, said the ""Look East"" policy adopted by many African countries has been inspired by China's achievements in many fronts. ""The cooperation between Asian and African countries is bound to succeed since we have shared history and future goals,"" he said. He added that guided by the Bandung Spirit, cooperation between Asia and Africa will be further promoted. ""The Bandung Spirit will rekindle our shared dreams with Asia and chart a new course in our path to economic prosperity, political rejuvenation, peace and sustainable development,"" Maluki said. Joshua Kivuva, a political scientist at the same university, also expressed optimism about future cooperation between Africa and China. ""In Africa, we have realized rapid progress due to partnership with China and other economic powers in Southeast Asia,"" he said. The expert predicted a new blueprint after the summit for the future socioeconomic development of the world's two fastest growing continents, as well as their cooperation in such fields as trade and science and technology. ""There could be challenges based on our different political and cultural systems but they should not blur the bigger vision of realizing shared growth and prosperity,"" he said. In the view of Bethwel Kinuthia, an economist at the University of Nairobi, African countries will greatly benefit from China's ""Belt and Road"" initiatives, namely the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. ""China's proposed 21st Century Maritime Silk Road will definitely revive ancient trade routes that were the bedrock of civilization across a vast swath of the world,"" he said. He said that historically, the Asia-Pacific region had fueled global trade that immensely benefited Africa, adding the creation of a robust trade route linking African and Chinese markets will ultimately boost economic growth on the African continent. ""The Silk Road will enhance interactions among Asian and African people, promote friendship and knowledge sharing in diverse fields like education, technology, culture, agriculture, manufacturing and medicine,"" he said. Asanga Abeyagoonasekera, former chairman of the International Relations and Strategy Research Institute of Sri Lanka, said that the core of the Bandung Spirit is to promote cooperation between Asia and Africa and that China has played a key role in this regard. ""President Xi's wish to strengthen this cooperation as good friends and brothers is a very important remark at a time when both Asia and Africa are facing many challenges to improve the economic environment in many nations, including Sri Lanka,"" he said.

Joseph Ma'ahanua, a foreign affairs official of Solomon Islands, said Xi ""made a lot of positive announcements"" in his speech, including training opportunities and a zero-tariff policy, which will help a large number of developing countries. He said there is clearly more room for Asia-Africa cooperation in many areas. ""I think Xi's announcement itself is a good start ... (It was) made in a way that serves as a platform for more practice to come,"" he said. Oh Ei Sun, a senior research fellow at Nanyang Technology University of Singapore and former political secretary to the Malaysian prime minister, said Xi's reiteration of the Bandung Spirit is of great significance under the current international situation when hegemony still hangs on. A series of initiatives proposed by China on global development, including the Belt and Road and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, showed that it will offer help to other countries without any political condition, he said. Li Renliang, a professor at Thailand's National Institute of Development Administration, said that through the promotion of cooperation, China hopes it will become a true friend of Asian and African nations.

In a written interview with Xinhua ahead of the anniversary, Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia Xie Feng said countries in Asia and Africa should deepen practical cooperation on the basis of inheriting and carrying on Bandung Spirit, adding that the Chinese initiatives would inject new impetus into the cooperation between the two continents. According to Xie, the mutually beneficial and friendly cooperation between developing economies, including the Asian and African countries, is an important part of China's major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics. Xi's upcoming visit to Indonesia for the Asian-African summit and activities commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Bandung Conference demonstrates China's determination in promoting cooperation and common development of the countries in Asia and Africa, he added. Six decades ago, pursuing peaceful co-existence and seeking common ground while reserving differences were the theme of the Bandung Spirit. Today, the spirit features common development and win-win cooperation. Xie said Asian and African countries should keep up with the times and create a new type of international relations with win-win cooperation as its core values. According to the ambassador, on economy, Asian and African countries should uphold common development, seek partnership on the basis of complementary advantages and maximize the benefits of all parties. On politics, Asian and African countries should insist on equality and justice, increase the voice and representation of developing economies, and promote democratization, legalization and rationalization of international relations. On culture, Asian and African countries should stick to the spirit of inclusion and mutual reference, respect the diversity of cultures and promote harmonious co-existence. On security, Asian and African countries should advocate the principle of common, cooperative, comprehensive and sustainable security to create a safe environment worldwide. The Asian-African Conference this year is themed ""Strengthening South-South Cooperation to Promote World Peace and Prosperity."" As the largest developing country in the world, China has always been a supporter, practitioner and leader of Asian-African cooperation, Xie said, adding that China has strengthened bilateral and regional dialogues and cooperation and deepened trade and investment ties with countries in Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. China has played a significant role in poverty reduction in the developing world from Asia to Africa through infrastructure development, human resources development, tariff breaks and debt relief. ""The China-proposed 'One Belt, One Road' initiatives will provide opportunities to Asian-African nations and contribute to Asian-African cooperation,"" Xie said. This year marks the 65th anniversary of the establishment of the diplomatic ties between China and Indonesia. ""China-Indonesia relations have come through an extraordinary path and achieved historical progress over the 65 years. Leaders of both sides expect mutually beneficial cooperation and attach great attention to bilateral relations, which run at a high level, as top-level visits between the two countries are very frequent these years,"" said Xie. Indonesia has become a founding member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and has been communicating with China to promote institutionalized arrangements and concrete measures in such areas as infrastructure, investment and manufacturing capacity. It also wishes to push forward the construction of Maritime Silk Road and make some achievements as early as possible. ""China is willing to take the opportunity of the 65th anniversary of diplomatic ties and the 60th anniversary of the Bandung Conference to work alongside with Indonesia to align development strategies and deepen pragmatic cooperation to push forward China-Indonesia comprehensive strategic partnership,"" the ambassador said."

But the thought of it is something most people try to avoid. For expats, the possibility of death overseas might be a touchy matter, but the uncomfortable question is unavoidable: What happens to the remains if a person dies in China? Usually, family members handle the paperwork and other formalities in the process of bringing a departed loved one back home. Help is available through companies in China that specialize in the repatriation of deceased expatriates. One such enterprise is Roseates, a Beijing-based body repatriation service. The company has assisted in the transport of an average of 150 individuals annually back to their countries of origin. According to China's National Funeral Association, which set up a nationwide network for international body repatriation, about 1,800 bodies are shipped out of China every year. ""The main causes of foreigners' deaths here are heart attacks and respiratory problems,"" said Belgium-born Wilfried Verbruggen, who founded Roseates in 2007. But Verbruggen said the job over the past eight years has not been easy. Under current regulations, the company can only operate as a mediator. ""We depend on a certain number of licensed funeral homes, which are appointed by China's National Funeral Association, to take care of the main procedures,"" he said, adding that these tasks include the embalming and storage of the body. Under international law, the normal process of repatriation begins once a body is discovered and reported to an embassy, which then contacts the next of kin. To transport the body, preservation is required first, Verbruggen said. Then, a translated death certificate and a quarantine certificate are obtained, and the company provides a coffin. Once the paperwork is done, a flight is arranged to transport the remains. ""Roseates has a fixed fee of 7,500 yuan ($1,200) for our services, but total costs of the repatriation can climb to an average of 80,000 yuan due to the costs imposed by the local funeral homes,"" Verbruggen said. China's funerary industry is State-controlled and offers fixed prices for Chinese nationals. But when it comes to assisting foreigners, fees can increase significantly. For example, the official price for embalming in China is 300 yuan. But foreigners pay an average of 8,000. For body storage, the average Chinese tariff is around 3 to 4 yuan per hour, but for foreigners it can jump to 20 yuan, he said. In Shanghai, two funeral businesses, Longhua Funeral Parlor and Baoxing Funeral Parlor, offer a package of services, including embalming, finding a coffin and helping with the quarantine inspection. Foreigners also face restrictions on burial in China. In 2008, the Ministry of Civil Affairs released a regulation on the management of foreigners' funerals and interment that largely banned their being buried in China. In the case of cremation, some provinces and regions allow ashes to be buried. For example, Shanghai Wanguo Cemetery takes applications if the deceased foreigners have made ""exceptional contributions"" to Chinese society, but the application needs to get municipal government approvals."

The statement said the leading group will be in charge of guiding and coordinating work related to the initiatives. It did not specify the group members, but said the office is under the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planner. The blueprint for the China-proposed Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road initiatives is set to fuel the Chinese economy, boosting the development of less-developed and inland regions, analysts said. China on Saturday unveiled the blueprint which called for policy coordination, financial cooperation, infrastructure building and free trade to leverage the comparative advantages of the natural resources in various regions. The idea, raised by Chinese President Xi Jinpingin 2013, is to lay infrastructure networks to better connect its economy with the rest of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Xi said on Sunday at the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) that his target for the Belt and Road plan is to increase total trade volume with neighboring countries to over $2.5 trillion in 10 years. The action plan came three days ahead of Tuesday's deadline of the application to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a China-initiated lender which will offer financing for regional infrastructure projects. Besides efforts to speed up the development of more developed coastal region like the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone, inland regions are poised to become the new focus for the grand plan. Northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is earmarked to be the core area on the Silk Road Economic Belt as a key transportation, trade and logistics center. It has geographical advantages of being a gateway to Central, South and West Asian countries. The authorities also pledge to advance the building of the Ningxia Inland Opening-up Pilot Economic Zone as a trade and logistical hub for industrial and cultural exchanges with Central, South and West Asian countries. Northeastern regions, including Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning provinces, are also open to cooperation with Russia's Far East region on sea-land multi-modal transport. ""The plan will break the current bottleneck in China's economic development as shown in the divide between coastal and inland regions by providing strategic support for the less developed regions,"" Han Meng, a research fellow of the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. Over the last 30-plus years since the implementation of China's reform and opening-up, inland regions like Xinjiang and Gansu Province have lagged behind in investment because of undeveloped transport systems, Han said. As China's economy experiences the ""new normal"" with a slower GDP growth, the Belt and Road initiatives will facilitate China's ongoing economic restructuring in its shift away from low-end production, Han noted. To expand cooperation, China will negotiate with countries and regions along the Belt and Road routes on opening free trade areas with lower non-tariff barriers. It will also push forward negotiations on bilateral investment protection agreements and double taxation avoidance agreements to protect the lawful rights and interests of investors. Chen Ji, director of the China Center for the research of Industrial Economics at the Capital University of Economics and Business, told the Global Times that the new plan will further provide stimulus to economic structural reform. ""As China increases economic exchanges with nearby regions, it can tap into more potential markets. Increased trade will also provide a further boost to the free trade zones as part of China's plan for a more market-oriented economy,"" said Chen. Speaking at the Boao Forum on Saturday with the Global Times, Xiang Wenbo, president of Sany Heavy Industry Co, the world's sixth-largest heavy equipment manufacturer, said that 70 to 80 percent of the company's products were consumed by countries along the ""One Belt, One Road"" region. He believes Chinese companies like his will be able to explore bigger a market potential with the initiatives. The BFA closed on Sunday. The conference was attended by 2,786 political, business and academic leaders as well as journalists from 49 countries and regions. Liang Fei contributed to this story"

Investment and trade cooperation is a major task in building the Belt and Road, said the plan named Vision and Actions on Jointly Building Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road. ""We should strive to improve investment and trade facilitation, and remove barriers for the creation of a sound business environment within the region and in all related countries,"" noted the plan. China will speed up investment facilitation, eliminate investment barriers and push forward negotiations on bilateral investment protection agreements and double taxation avoidance agreements to protect the lawful rights and interests of investors. ""We should lower non-tariff barriers, jointly improve the transparency of technical trade measures, and enhance trade liberalization and facilitation,"" said the plan. To expand cooperation, China will discuss with countries and regions along the Belt and Road on opening free trade areas so as to unleash great business potential. China will increase cooperation in the exploration and development of coal, oil, gas, metal minerals and other conventional energy sources, said the plan, issued by the National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Commerce. The country will also advance cooperation in hydropower, nuclear power, wind power, solar power and other clean, renewable energy sources. ""We should make innovations in our forms of trade, and develop cross-border e-commerce and other modern business models,"" said the plan. In addition, China will push forward cooperation in emerging industries, including new-generation information technology, biotechnology, new energy technology, new materials and others.

""It is impossible to make unnecessary concessions in line with my trip to the United States,"" Abe told a Diet session, adding that the TPP free trade talks are ""in the final phase, but problems remain"". The prime minister made the remarks ahead of his eight-day visit to the United States from April 26, and he will visit the White House on April 28 to have a summit with Obama who is eager to conclude the marathon TPP talks at an early date so as to leave positive legacy for his Democrats in future presidential elections. Japan is reluctant to open its agriculture market, particularly on rice and pork, to inexpensive U.S. products, while the United States is considering that when it will remove its tariff over Japan-import cars. The Lingering differences between the two major economies in the 12-member bloc are regarded as a drag on the whole negotiations. Abe's comments undoubtedly cast shadows over the conclusion of the talks. However, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman on Thursday expressed his confidence of an early deal. ""We do feel that we can close this out in a very small number of months,"" he said in Washington. Obama visited Japan in April last year with an ambitious plan to push forward their TPP-related talks. The president sought to acquire Japan's concession by reiterating U.S. defense commitment to its ally over disputed islets with neighbouring countries. Abe's U.S. trip will also make him the first Japanese leader to address the Congress on April 29. ""His address will provide an opportunity for the American people to hear from one of our closest allies about ways we can expand our cooperation on economic and security priorities,"" John Boehner, House of Representatives speaker, said in a statement. However, regarding the Japanese leader's historical revisionism, a group of U.S. World War II soldiers and their relatives have said Abe should only be invited to Congress for a speech if he admits Japan's historical responsibility for its wartime conduct, according to Japan's Kyodo News. The well-known rightist leader set up an expert panel to provide advices to shape his statement for the 70th anniversary of the end of WWII, and the majority of the 16-member panel argued that the word of ""aggression"" should not be used in the statement as there is no world-recognized definition of ""aggression."" Rightist and historical revisionism politics walked by Abe increasingly prompted concerns from its neighboring China and South Korea and prominent world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and UN chief Ban Ki-moon, who have urged Japan to face up to its wartime atrocities. Continuously frayed ties between Japan and its neighbors also forced Washington on Thursday to emphasize that Japan should approach history issues""in a way that promotes healing and reconciliation."" The Tokyo's key ally expressed its disappointment over Abe's Yasukuni visit in 2013. Calling as the corner stone of Japan's diplomacy, Japan-U.S. defense alliance is also rocked by the thorny issue of the U.S. Futenma airbase relocation plan. Japan's southernmost island prefecture of Okinawa, where the U.S. base is located, ordered Monday to suspend underwater work in the Henoko coastal area in Nago city in the prefecture for the base's replacement. Okinawa Governor Takeshi Onaga warned that if the Okinawa Defense Bureau does not follow the order, the Okinawa government would revoke in a week its permit granted to the bureau for rock drilling at the site. But the Japanese central government neglected the prefecture's demand. The Okinawa Times editorial chief said recently that the Okinawa government and the central government are facing overall confrontation and situation has never had in local governments in postwar era, adding the central government's tough means is triggering more concerns. The relocation plan of the U.S. airbase has for long troubled the Japan-U.S. alliance and relations between the prefecture and the Japanese central government. Anti-U.S. base sentiment is deep in Okinawa that holds a bulk of U.S. bases in Japan. The issue will also weigh on Abe's U.S. journey."

At the 13th Asian airline development conference that closed on Tuesday, Yunnan Airport Group Co. Ltd., which runs 12 airports in the southwestern province, reached agreement with 10 international and domestic airlines for new routes and resources. Budget Malaysian carrier Air Asia agreed to open six new international routes linking Yunnan with neighboring countries, said Liu Huixin, a member of the Air Asia delegation. The Yunnan airport group also signed agreements with Canada's Prince George and Toronto airports. ""The belt and road initiatives have invigorated the aviation market in west China,"" said Huang Wenliang of Singapore Changi Airport. Direct flights from Kunming to Paris, the first destination outside Asia, began in December and flights to Vancouver should begin this year. Flights from megacity Chongqing to Rome will begin in April. Yunnan, which borders Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, is expected to have 20 airports served by 410 international and domestic air routes by 2020 with an annual passenger turnover of 100 million, according to Ding Shaoxiang, deputy provincial governor. China's aviation authority wants airlines to open more routes in west China, and is focused on improving the market for low-cost carriers, opening up the skies and simplifying approval of international routes, said deputy head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China Zhou Laizhen. Zhou sees Yunnan as an air transportation hub linking west China with Southeast and South Asia. In the past, aviation focused on eastern regions and the domestic market, said Zhou. Now international routes outperform domestic routes, and central and western China have become targets for airlines. Kunming, capital of Yunnan, and the cities of Chengdu, Chongqing and Xi'an in west China now offer international transit passengers 72-hour visa-free stays. ""This year we will apply for tariff-free aviation oil business at Kunming airport,"" said Jiang Wenzhong, vice president of the Yunnan airport group. ""Whatever airlines or other service providers all hope to share the dividends brought by the Belt and Road initiatives through expanding the aviation market in west China,"" said Christophe Potocki, general manager of ASEAN and Pacific Sales of ATR, the world's largest turboprop aircraft maker. About 1,000 delegates from 113 airlines, 283 airports and 45 tourism administrations across the world attended the three-day conference in Kunming."

By carrying out a new round of high-quality opening up, an endeavor highlighted by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in an annual government work report, China enters a new phase in regard to its opening-up policies, said Prof. Tang Zhimin, director of China ASEAN Studies under Bangkok-based Panyapiwat Institute of Management. The shift of focus will happen in several aspects, he noted. Instead of seeking access to market in developed economies and attracting foreign capital, efforts will be focused on promoting cooperation under such initiatives as the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and the Silk Road Economic Belt, Tang said. In terms of trade facilitation, the country will focus on forging bilateral and multilateral FTAs, instead of reducing tariffs and eliminating non-tariff trade barriers. China will also undergo status change from being a major exporter of goods to that of technologies and capital, from purely a receiver of international rules to a crucial party in the global rule-making process, Tang added. The Silk Road initiative will expedite the export of Chinese equipment, said Huang Bin, a China expert with Kasikorn Research Center, a Thai think tank. ""But more importantly, they will help promote infrastructure, international competitiveness and people's quality of life in countries involved. Regional connectivity will also be enhanced,"" he said. Huang also noted that the ""Made in China 2025"" strategy was one of the highlights of the government work report, saying it would have great impact on China's economic restructuring and the global economy as well."" The strategy integrates several factors such as China's bid to upgrade its industries, the aspirations of Chinese enterprises to go global and key initiatives such as the Maritime Silk Road and Silk Road Economic Belt, he said. It is hopeful that in the next decade, China will grow into a real manufacturing power that boasts a higher level of technology know-how and competitiveness in the high-end market, Huang said."

The bill makes clear that a tax can only be levied or canceled through the law and the basic system of taxation can only be decided by the law. It is heard by about 3,000 deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC), a rare arrangement as most of the laws are read and adopted by the 171-member NPC Standing Committee at its bi-monthly sessions. The current Legislation Law has already adopted the principle of statutory taxation but it is buried in a provision together with other matters that must be decided by the law, such as basic fiscal, tariff and financial systems. The draft revision singled the principle out in one provision. It is considered an attempt by the national legislature to change the current taxation arrangement. Of China's 18 existing taxes, only three -- individual income tax, corporate income tax, and vehicle and vessel tax -- are levied through legislation, while the others are imposed through formal or provisional regulations issued by the State Council. Such an arrangement was laid because the NPC Standing Committee had authorized the State Council to levy taxes about business activities in 1985 when the country embarked on its sweeping reform and opening up. As the circumstance changed, both the legislature and public have realized the pressing need to install the complete statutory taxation, said Liang Ying, a member of staff with the Legislative Affairs Commission of the NPC Standing Committee. Fu Ying, spokeswoman for the third session of the 12th NPC, told a press conference on Wednesday that China aims to realize full statutory taxation by 2020. Fu explained that statutory taxation means that what taxes to be levied, to whom the taxes are collected and tax rates will all be decided by laws enacted by the top legislature. ""In the next few years, I believe we will have legislations on all 18 taxes. Any new tax, such as real estate tax and environment tax that are being mulled, should also be imposed by the law,"" Liang said. Explaining why the country needs the complete statutory taxation now, Liang said empowering the legislature to impose tax can ensure a more transparent process and an independent stance from any interest groups. It also makes it more rigid to adjust the taxes, which will increase the sense of stability for citizens and businesses, he said. Statutory taxation was listed in the overall reform blueprint adopted by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee at its key session in November 2013."

""China's determination and endeavor to conquer pollution is a good sign not only for China, but for the world as a whole,"" Mauricio Avila, an environmental scientist told Xinhua in an exclusive interview. ""I am optimistic that the Chinese people will figure out ways and give the world a surprise in dealing with this challenge,"" said the expert. Avila, who was a professor with the Environment Department of Ecuador's Central University and an independent consultant, now works for the oil company Andes Petroleum Ecuador as the manager for health and safety. ""The commitments made by top leaders at China's annual sessions of the top legislature and political advisory body are fundamental to the management of environmental problems. We are full of confidence that the Chinese people are able to handle pollution with due efforts,"" he added. The Chinese government announced this week that it will fight resolutely against pollution, including emissions of PM10 and PM2.5, two key air pollutants. According to a 2015-2020 action plan released Friday jointly by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Finance Ministry, China will slash coal consumption by 160 million tons in the next five years to reduce air pollution. Relative measures will involve eliminating outdated production capacity and using clean energy such as hydropower, nuclear, wind and solar energy. On Friday, President Xi Jinping asked Chinese people to protect the environment like ""caring for one's own eyes and life."" ""We are going to punish, with an iron hand, any violators who destroy ecology or environment, with no exceptions,"" said Xi while reviewing the work report of the State Council together with National People's Congress (NPC) deputies. In his annual report at the NPC, Premier Li Keqiang compared pollution to ""a blight on people's quality of life"" and promised that China will cut emission of carbon dioxide by at least 3.1 percent this year. Avila said he was impressed by China's vitality and rapid economic development when he visited Beijing five years ago, adding that China has all the tools to achieve the objective, since ""it has very organized, hard-working people."" ""It is necessary to seek cleaner energy alternatives even though it is complicated and difficult,"" he said, noting that ""it can be wind, solar or hydropower. What we need to do is to explore all those possibilities."" The expert stressed that today's society can not live without hydrocarbons like fossil fuels, but ""a conscious handling with good environmental practices and with high standards of environmental protection"" is key to reducing pollution. Furthermore, Avila said proper fiscal and financial policies can help inject more funds into environment protection. ""It's important to make tax credits, tariff rebates and safeguards available as an incentive to promote cost-effective clean energy,"" he said."

China's search for much-needed raw materials, markets and employment for its people cannot be interpreted simply as neocolonialism resulting in a scramble for Africa's raw materials, Stephen McQueen, an independent political consultant, said in an interview with Xinhua. ""To dismiss as such, is a misrepresentation of the realities."" The African continent is blessed with many raw materials but it needs the skills, training, funds and infrastructure required to create an environment conducive for the development of Africa's full potential, more particularly for the local beneficiation and utilization of its raw materials, which will be of enormous benefit to Africa. Moreover, Africa has a vibrant, young, growing population yearning to learn and earn, to labor and to provide a better life for itself. ""The new Africa will not tolerate an approach that smacks of neocolonialism, and will be very protective of its own business interests,"" and it has proved that China is not taking this approach, McQueen said. The enormous increase in Chinese involvement in Africa over the last 20 years has resulted in much major economic and infrastructural development, and Africa is today better placed to take advantage of any economic recovery which may follow, he added. ""Chinese involvement in Africa is neither a self-serving exploitation to obtain raw materials, nor a philanthropic mission, "" said McQueen. He said China has developed a ""business is business"" approach, it wants to be seen as a partner in overcoming difficulties. A ""new type of strategic partnership"" has developed in Africa following a number of summits held between China and African countries. The plan is based on ""pragmatic cooperation, equality and mutual benefit."" The consequences of this plan have, inter alia, been the growing of aid to Africa, the setting up a China-Africa Development Fund and the encouraging of Chinese companies to invest in Africa. To this end preferential loans have been granted, Chinese markets have been further opened by increasing the number of items from Africa which receive zero-tariff treatment in China. In the process, thousands of African people have been trained and many hospitals and schools have been built. Trade between Africa and China is no new phenomenon. The two sides have developed their ties into full-scale trading relations. China has been Africa's largest trade partner since 2009, with the volume reaching 166.3 billion dollars in 2011 and nearly 200 billion dollars in 2012. Africa's desire is not only the exporting of these raw materials, but more importantly the transformation of these materials in Africa, resulting in the creation of employment locally and increasing trade from Africa to the other parts of the world. In assisting Africa, in a spirit of partnership, to overcome its own challenges and in helping Africa to become a hub of investment and trade, China has helped Africa strengthen its independence and build a healthy interdependence - the result of a partnership approach, McQueen said. China has large reserves of funds and thousands of skilled engineers available and is clearly ready to get involved in Africa in order to enhance its contribution to the development of Africa. ""Chinese involvement in Africa in a structured, well-planned manner, focussing on the development of essential infrastructure and the creation of a larger market in and through Africa will assist transform Africa to speed its goal of sound economic development,"" McQueen said. ""This can only be advantageous to both Africa and China to play a positive and constructive role, characterized by a spirit of partnership to the benefit of all."" Speaking of challenges confronting Africa-China cooperation, McQueen said the biggest challenge facing Africa is how to convert ""extractors of raw materials"" into ""transformers of raw materials"" on the continent. This will help in the creation of employment locally which is imperative for the long-term stability of Africa. ""Building roads and railways to harbors and connecting major cities in Africa will enhance the trade that is needed to grow the African economy."""

""The revision may boost natural gas demand in the short term, without hurting operational margins,"" said the report. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) announced last Saturday that it would set a universal price for non-residential natural gas and liberalize pricing for jet fuel and natural gas supplied directly to industrial users. Ceiling city gate prices for new incremental non-residential gas customers will fall 0.44 yuan (less than 1 U.S. cent) per cubic meter as of April 1, in line with drops to the price of fuel and liquefied natural gas (LPG) since the second half of 2014. Meanwhile, the ceiling city gate prices for existing non-residential gas customers will rise marginally by 0.04 yuan per cubic meter. Thus, existing and new customers will pay the same price. Fitch expects the price adjustment to help city gas distributors boost gas volume in the short term. In 2014, China's total natural gas consumption volume recorded a growth rate of just 5.1 percent to 176 billion cubic meters, its weakest growth in the past decade. This move, albeit only for commercial users currently, is also a further step towards a truly market oriented pricing model for gas in China, said Fitch. In addition, the NDRC's announcement affirmed its plan to adopt a multi-level natural gas tariff for residential users nationwide by end of 2015, which could also increase the gas distributors' profits from the residential segment, according to Fitch.

There have been many voices on China-Africa relations over the years. Some hail China's increasingly prominent existence in Africa as a boost to Africa's development, while some, mostly in the West, insist on throwing a wet blanket on China-Africa cooperation, hence fantastic theories like ""neocolonialism,"" ""plunderer of Africa's resources"" and the latest ""concrete diplomacy."" Despite some ""growing pains"" between China and Africa over the years, it is indisputable that Africa has benefited a lot from the China-Africa cooperation, which has been attested by growing trade due to improved infrastructure in the continent. ""CONCRETE DIPLOMACY"" Although one has difficulty in understanding what wrong with a ""concrete diplomacy"" for a continent which needs badly infrastructure projects, the phrase circulates in the Western media in many reports covering China-Africa cooperation. World Bank senior transport specialist Justin Runji told Zambia Daily Mail the transport was big business and an important catalyst for spurring economic development in Africa. The World Bank official however expressed concern that in the recent past, some donors have withdrawn their support to the transport sector in Africa. China has become Africa's largest trade partner, and Africa is now China's second largest overseas construction project contract market and the fourth largest investment destination, according to the 2013 white paper on China-Africa Economic and Trade Cooperation"" by the State Council of China. Up to now, China has completed 1,046 projects in Africa, building 2,233 kilometers of railways and 3,530 kilometers of roads, among others, promoting intra-African trade and helping it integrate into the global economy. A Chinese company is constructing a standard gauge railway in Kenya, which is also expected to connect to more countries in East Africa. ""CHINA IS EXPLOITING AFRICA'S RESOURCES"" Believers of such theories seem to ignore the simple fact that Western powers have been holding their grounds in production of natural resources like oil, gas and minerals in many African countries. According to a report quoted by the Wikipedia, joint ventures between foreign companies and Nigerian government account for approximately 95 percent of all crude oil output in Nigeria, while local independent companies operating in marginal fields account for the remaining 5 percent. And the top six foreign companies operating in Nigeria are all of western origin, including Shell Nigeria who accounts for 50 percent of Nigerian's total oil production. The same story happens in many other African countries: Angola, Zambia, Botswana, etc., a story neglected by some people in the West perhaps because they have taken this for granted for too long to remember. China's investment in Africa has been diversified alongside improvement of level of investment. Currently, over 2,000 Chinese enterprises are investing and developing in more than 50 African countries and regions, and cooperation fields have expanded from agriculture, mining and building industry to intensive processing of resource products, industrial manufacturing, finance, commercial logistics and realestate. COOPERATION IN AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY Agriculture is crucial for stable development and poverty reduction efforts in Africa. In recent years, Sino-Africa trade in agriculture products has grown quickly. From 2009 to 2012, China's agricultural exports to Africa grew from 1.58 billion to 2.49 billion, an increase of 57.6 percent. During the same period, China's agricultural imports from Africa grew from 1.16 billion dollars to 2.86 billion dollars, a 146 percent increase. Most imported agricultural products are non- food items, including cotton, hemp, silk, oil seeds and other such products. China adopted in 2005 zero-tariff policy for some African products. Chinese enterprises also invest in fields like breeding improved seeds, planting grain and cash crops, and processing agricultural products. CAPACITY BUILDING Africa has sustained rapid economic growth in recent years, but it still faces severe development problems and difficult task of accomplishing the UN Millennium Goals. China has in the recent years developed cooperation with Africa in areas relating to public amenities, medical and health care, climate change and environmental protection, humanitarian aid,and other fields. China has also strengthened cultural and educational exchanges and scientific and cooperation in an effort to improve Africa's ability to develop independently. From 2010 to 2012, China helped build 27 hospitals in Ghana, Zimbabwe and other African countries. China has also sent 43 medical teams to 42 African countries and regions, treating over 5. 57 million patients. Since November 2009, China has carried out more than 100 clean energy projects in African countries, including biogas technology cooperation with Tunisia, Guinea and the Sudan, solar and wind power generation in Morocco, Ethiopia and South Africa."

Thanks to the country's fatter wallets and increasingly diverse diet, China imported 320,000 metric tons of fresh milk and 283,000 tons of mutton in 2014, up 73.5 and 9.3 percent year-on-year, according to the General Administration of Customs. The world's most populous nation also purchased 71.4 million tons of soybeans and 383 million liters of wine from overseas markets, up 12.7 and 1.6 percent, respectively, from a year earlier. The value of its fruit imports reached $9.19 billion last year, rising 6.3 percent on a year-on-year basis. Ding Lixin, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing, says even though the prices of mining resource-based commodities such as coal and iron ore are quite low at the moment in the global market, international wine producers, meat suppliers and dairy product providers have become the biggest beneficiaries of China's market boom for agricultural products. ""The stable growth of China's agricultural output and rising national incomes have provided diversified access to food with a higher protein content and better taste,"" says Ding. ""As a result, China has adequately raised the quantity of its grain imports, especially corn, soybeans, rapeseed meal and sorghum, over the past decade to support the growth of its livestock and aquatic feed industries."" Food consumption is normally a clear indicator of a nation's economic health and the size of its population. In China, meat consumption is rising, and people are eating a greater variety. Staple foodstuffs such as meat, fish, eggs and milk have become more sophisticated, and consumers now look for more choices in terms of health and convenience. As many people in China, in particular in urban areas, are increasingly aware that pork contains more fat and less protein than lamb, the country's pork consumption and import volume dropped 2 and 3.3 percent on a year-on-year basis in 2014. Yu Bin, director of the department of macroeconomic research at the State Council Development Research Center, says although changes in food consumption reflect greater economic vitality, the country's ongoing urbanization and upwardly mobile population are other key factors that have shifted Chinese diets from being mostly grain-based to ones that include more meat and dairy products. Chinese citizens consumed an average of 17.2 kilograms of mutton per capita in 2014, compared with 12 kilograms in 2008. The Beijing-based China Meat Association predicts that this figure will reach 28 kg between 2017 and 2022. Yu says demand for lamb in China's western region, particularly in the Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions, and Qinghai and Gansu provinces, has quickly grown over the past five years, mainly because it is getting more expensive to raise sheep in western China, where the economy and livestock industry are less developed than in the eastern provinces. Due to rising feed prices, limited grazing land and the breeding cycle, China's sheep breeding sector lags behind consumer demand, resulting in higher lamb prices over the past five years, according to a report released last December by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. ""As China has found it impossible to grow all of the food it needs and has consequently formed closer ties with the world food market, demand for fruit, olive oil, wine, meat and dairy products will certainly provide many opportunities for major agricultural produce exporters such as Australia, the United States, Chile, Brazil and Argentina,"" Yu says. Eager to meet domestic demand for various foodstuffs, the Chinese government has increased international trade in food products through trading arrangements such as signing free trade agreements or non-tariff deals for certain agricultural products with its trading partners in Europe, Africa and South America. As China and Australia announced the practical conclusion of negotiations on an FTA last November, Zheng Fengtian, a professor at the school of agricultural economics and rural development at Renmin University of China in Beijing, says the prices of many Australian agricultural products will be fairly attractive to the Chinese buyers under the China-Australia FTA framework. The agreement will cover more than 10 areas, including a simplified review procedure for investments, most-favored-nation status, favorable market access rules and market transparency. China now imposes 12 to 25 percent tariffs on Australian beef, but these levies will be phased out within nine years under the pact. Tariffs on Australian wine will also be dropped by 2018. Australian beef accounted for 56 percent of China's beef imports in 2014. The agribusiness research department of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd has forecast that the total value of Australian beef shipped to China will reach A$130 billion ($102 billion) by 2030."

In an exclusive interview with Xinhua on Saturday, Munir said he is optimistic for ASEAN's ambitious target of achieving closer economic integration by setting up the AEC by the end of this year. The blueprint of the AEC was first put forward by ASEAN leaders at its 13th summit in November 2007. At Last summit held in Myanmar, ASEAN leaders agree to formally announce the establishment of the AEC by 31 December, 2015. However, economists and experts believe that it will be a long way to go for the ASEAN to have an effective economic community like European Union. ""I am optimistic but impatient. The potential is huge that one should grape it,"" he said. ""The single market on production base formed, ASEAN, by 2030 will be the fourth largest economy in the world after EU, China, US, a huge prospects,"" he said. On the potentials of the ASEAN market, Munir said, ""unlike China and Japan, where the population is aging, 50 percent of the ASEAN population are under 30, young, growing and big, therefore, there will be a consumer boom, and a lot of potential demand for business, goods, services"". ""So every potential should be enhanced, must be made to ensure that we achieve the single market and a single production base,"" he added. However, Munir admitted that there are difficulties and challenges for ASEAN to bring about greater and closer economic integration under the AEC. He said, ""duing the last decade, tariff rates among ASEAN nations have come down, however, there are lots of non-tariff barriers, a lot of non-tariff measures are existing, these are the challenges must be removed because there are many ways could stop goods coming in, there are many ways could frustrate the free trade despite the fact that the tariff rate is zero"". Besides, he believed that there are fears among some from the ASEAN nations about the market becoming one, especially among those from the small and medium enterprises. ""Most of the enterprises in ASEAN countries like Indonesia, Myanmar, Cambodia are very micro, so they fear they are not strong enough to face the open market,"" said Munir. ""The concerns of the small and medium enterprises must be addressed,"" he said, adding that small and medium enterprises are crucial to the economy of ASEAN as in some member countries, they employ over 90 percent of the workforce. When asked to compare the AEC with EU, Munir said, ""I don't think the AEC will come out like EU, I don't think there will be any surrender of sovereignty among the ASEAN countries, I don't think there will be a single currency of ASEAN."" ""It will be suicidal for ASEAN to have a single currency, because there are different economies and different fiscal policies and different economy systems,"" he said."

AEC is designed to bring about closer economic integration of the 10 nations. The meeting, titled ""21st ASEAN Economic Minister's Retreat, started with a preparatory meeting of senior economic officials from the 10 members. Sources from the meeting said this annual retreat is held in the northeastern city of Malaysia with the objective to enable the ministers to discuss more practical integration measures for AEC which is set to come into effect by December 31, 2015. The recommendations from the private sector and the concerns over a perceived increase in non-tariff barriers to trade in the region when the AEC comes into effect will top the agenda of the meeting. AEC is mainly an economic liberalization program aimed at increasing the international competitiveness of ASEAN and to make the ASEAN region as an attractive investment location. Officials attending the meeting believe that AEC, which is aimed at creating a single market and production base in the region, will further bolster the bloc's progress and prosperity. However, many economists said there will be great challenges ahead for the AEC, including large differences in tax rates on ( intra-and trans-regional) businesses and investments, different standardizations of laws and regulations on business and on competition, large differences in the rates of interest and inflation and no ASEAN common currency."

Katia Abreu, the new agriculture minister stressed at a recent press conference the importance of channeling Chinese investment to Brazil's agricultural sector. Abreu, who is also president of the National Confederation of Agriculture, said Brazil and China should expand cooperation in the agricultural sector by not only boosting direct trade but exchanging more high value-added products. ""We need to sign more trade agreements with China. This desire is very strong for us,"" said Abreu. To further explore the Chinese market, Abreu will visit China in March this year, aiming to cut China's import tariff on Brazilian coffee and convince Chinese authorities to accept Brazilian health inspection standards for Brazil's meat industry. According to the Brazilian Agriculture Ministry, beef exports to China are expected to increase significantly, with exports to China rising from 37 million U.S. dollars in 2012 to at least 700 million dollars in 2015. Following an atypical case of mad cow disease in Brazil, China suspended Brazilian beef imports in 2012 and lifted the embargo last year. China is currently the largest importer of agricultural products of Brazil, representing 22 percent of the South American nation's total agricultural exports in 2014 and more than the total amount of its second to fifth largest export destinations, namely the United States, The Netherlands, Russia and Germany. Brazil is an agricultural powerhouse, whose total volume of agricultural production in 2014 accounts for 22.5 percent of the GDP. It is also the world's biggest producer and exporter of coffee, sugar and orange juice, the biggest meat exporter and the second-biggest producer and exporter of soy products, as well as a major grower of corn. On coffee export, Abreu said, ""Brazilian coffee is vigorously promoting its brand worldwide and expanding its awareness. I hope that more Chinese can drink Brazilian coffee."""

When meeting with President of the Swiss Confederation Simonetta Sommaruga in the Swiss ski resort of Davos on Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said that both sides should further implement the FTA, expand two-way investment and deepen cooperation in high-end manufacturing and modern agriculture so as to benefit the two countries. Switzerland has become China's first free trade partner in the world's 20 leading economies. Under the trade agreement, almost all Chinese exports to the European country are exempt from tariffs, while nearly 85 percent Swiss exports to China are duty-free. There is no doubt that the China-Swiss FTA has yielded fruitful achievements. Under the FTA framework, Switzerland and its competitive industries, including medicine, machinery, watch making and tourism, benefited from the vast Chinese market. Meanwhile, China imported cutting-edge technology from Switzerland, which helped accelerate industrial transformation and upgrade, and Chinese consumers are enjoying more tariff-free Swiss products. According to statistics, bilateral trade rose steadily and the trade structure has been optimized. From January to November 2014, trade volume between the two countries reached 38.86 billion U.S. dollars. The FTA between China and Switzerland serves as a model for economic cooperation between China and Europe as a whole. China and the European Union (EU), two world economic giants, have been involved in a series of trade disputes. However, Beijing is committed to resolving economic and trade frictions through dialogue and consultations and expressed its willingness to start a joint feasibility study on a China-EU FTA. China, which is going through a structural economic slowdown, and the EU, which is struggling for recovery, need each other. An FTA between China and the EU, the largest trading partner of China, will definitely promote the economic development of both sides and help fuel the world economy. South Korea has signed an FTA with the EU and Japan is also itching to get involved. Thus, it is high time for China and the EU, which together account for nearly 33 percent of the global economy, to start FTA negotiations as soon as possible to give full play to their respective advantages."

China has ended its quota system previously aimed at restricting exports of rare earths. [Photo/Xinhua] China has ended a quota system previously aimed at restricting exports of rare earths, a move in line with a World Trade Organization panel ruling last March. The Ministry of Commerce issued a notice at the end of December that abolished export quotas for rare earths, key elements in defence industry components and modern technology ranging from iPhones to wind turbines. The abolished export quotas also include tungsten, molybdenum and fluorspar. Chen Zhanheng, deputy secretary-general of the China Rare Earths Industry Association, said the removal of the quota system is expected to increase the number of exporting companies and that competition for exports will become fiercer, which in turn is likely to push up the price of the rare earths after prices hit rock bottom last year. Chen said previously there were 28 rare earths producers working under the export quotas. Now any company with export contract is eligible to export. Du Shuaibing, an analyst at natural resources consultancy Baichuan Information, however, said he thinks the removal will have little impact on the market as the export quota system had been ""invisible"" in recent years in any case, since actual export volumes fell short of the quotas. He said the major impact will come when a tariff of 15 to 25 percent is expected to be removed in May. Chen predicts the tariff will be lifted by June resulting in price competition across the global rare earths market as Chinese export prices lower. China produces more than 90 percent of global rare earths, effectively giving it control of supply of a group of key elements used in sectors such as defence and renewable energy. The country raised tariffs and imposed strict quotas in 2010 to not only protect its scarce resources but also reduce the environmental impact of their extraction, but importers in Japan, Europe and the United States complained that the move breached trade rules. China was widely expected to abolish the quota system and replace it with resource and environmental taxes following the WTO ruling in March last year. The government has said it sought to improve China's pricing power over rare earths by imposing strict domestic production caps and cracking down on illegal production and smuggling. It has also raised environmental and production standards and encouraged big State-owned firms to integrate with smaller producers."

""I've spent more than 31,000 yuan (about 5,000 U.S. dollars) this year - it's mostly 'haitao' (buying goods online from overseas),"" says Cao, 31, an accountant in Beijing. She started to haitao in 2012, and this year she's bought a handbag from England, milk powder from Australia, honey from New Zealand and cosmetics from Japan. She is among a fast growing number of Chinese online shoppers, most of them young, well educated and eager to buy foreign goods that are unavailable or exorbitantly priced in China. They are a multi-billion-dollar and still booming market for global e-retailers. TRILLION-YUAN POTENTIAL A report in September from market research company Nielsen said 18 million Chinese spent 216 billion yuan by haitao in 2013. It estimated the value would reach 1 trillion yuan in 2018 and the number of buyers 35.6 million. According to Internet industry consultancy iResearch, China's total online shopping sales hit 691.41 billion yuan in the third quarter of 2014, up 49.8 percent from the same period last year. The year's total cross-border e-commerce - inbound and outbound - is forecast to grow 30.6 percent from 2013 to reach 4 trillion yuan, accounting for 14.8 percent of total foreign trade. China's Ministry of Commerce forecasts cross-border trade by e-commerce companies in China will be worth 6.5 trillion yuan in 2016. POLICY SUPPORT The impetus comes from the government. In August 2013, China's State Council issued a policy to support cross-border e-commerce, with six concrete measures to facilitate processes, including Customs clearance, quarantine inspection, duties and foreign exchange. To date, six cities - Shanghai, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Zhengzhou, Guangzhou and Chongqing - have designated import e-commerce pilot zones, where foreign goods can be stored in bonded warehouses before Customs clearance. According to tax regulations in those cities, each order under 500 yuan (about 82 U.S. dollars) is duty-free, and each order from 500 to 1,000 yuan incurs a 10-percent tariff, compared with ordinary imported goods being taxed around 40 percent on average. Some pilot cities have also simplified their Customs regulations. In south China's Guangzhou, e-retailers can immediately register overseas goods with Customs when a Chinese buyer makes a deal, so tariff collection and other procedures are faster. Under Guangzhou's system, Chinese discount retailer Vip.com completed Customs clearance for 800 watches in just 40 minutes. On Nov. 11, the 22nd Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' Meeting in Beijing supported the trade with the APEC Cross Border E-Commerce Innovation and Development Initiative."

[Photo/Xinhua] China has ended a quota system previously aimed at restricting exports of rare earths, a move in line with a World Trade Organization panel ruling last March. The Ministry of Commerce issued a notice at the end of December that abolished export quotas for rare earths, key elements in defence industry components and modern technology ranging from iPhones to wind turbines. The abolished export quotas also include tungsten, molybdenum and fluorspar. Chen Zhanheng, deputy secretary-general of the China Rare Earths Industry Association, said the removal of the quota system is expected to increase the number of exporting companies and that competition for exports will become fiercer, which in turn is likely to push up the price of the rare earths after prices hit rock bottom last year. Chen said previously there were 28 rare earths producers working under the export quotas. Now any company with export contract is eligible to export. Du Shuaibing, an analyst at natural resources consultancy Baichuan Information, however, said he thinks the removal will have little impact on the market as the export quota system had been ""invisible"" in recent years in any case, since actual export volumes fell short of the quotas. He said the major impact will come when a tariff of 15 to 25 percent is expected to be removed in May. Chen predicts the tariff will be lifted by June resulting in price competition across the global rare earths market as Chinese export prices lower. China produces more than 90 percent of global rare earths, effectively giving it control of supply of a group of key elements used in sectors such as defence and renewable energy. The country raised tariffs and imposed strict quotas in 2010 to not only protect its scarce resources but also reduce the environmental impact of their extraction, but importers in Japan, Europe and the United States complained that the move breached trade rules. China was widely expected to abolish the quota system and replace it with resource and environmental taxes following the WTO ruling in March last year. The government has said it sought to improve China's pricing power over rare earths by imposing strict domestic production caps and cracking down on illegal production and smuggling. It has also raised environmental and production standards and encouraged big State-owned firms to integrate with smaller producers."

""I've spent more than 31,000 yuan (about 5,000 U.S. dollars) this year - it's mostly 'haitao' (buying goods online from overseas),"" says Cao, 31, an accountant in Beijing. She started to haitao in 2012, and this year she's bought a handbag from England, milk powder from Australia, honey from New Zealand and cosmetics from Japan. She is among a fast growing number of Chinese online shoppers, most of them young, well educated and eager to buy foreign goods that are unavailable or exorbitantly priced in China. They are a multi-billion-dollar and still booming market for global e-retailers. TRILLION-YUAN POTENTIAL A report in September from market research company Nielsen said 18 million Chinese spent 216 billion yuan by haitao in 2013. It estimated the value would reach 1 trillion yuan in 2018 and the number of buyers 35.6 million. According to Internet industry consultancy iResearch, China's total online shopping sales hit 691.41 billion yuan in the third quarter of 2014, up 49.8 percent from the same period last year. The year's total cross-border e-commerce - inbound and outbound - is forecast to grow 30.6 percent from 2013 to reach 4 trillion yuan, accounting for 14.8 percent of total foreign trade. China's Ministry of Commerce forecasts cross-border trade by e-commerce companies in China will be worth 6.5 trillion yuan in 2016. POLICY SUPPORT The impetus comes from the government. In August 2013, China's State Council issued a policy to support cross-border e-commerce, with six concrete measures to facilitate processes, including Customs clearance, quarantine inspection, duties and foreign exchange. To date, six cities - Shanghai, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Zhengzhou, Guangzhou and Chongqing - have designated import e-commerce pilot zones, where foreign goods can be stored in bonded warehouses before Customs clearance. According to tax regulations in those cities, each order under 500 yuan (about 82 U.S. dollars) is duty-free, and each order from 500 to 1,000 yuan incurs a 10-percent tariff, compared with ordinary imported goods being taxed around 40 percent on average. Some pilot cities have also simplified their Customs regulations. In south China's Guangzhou, e-retailers can immediately register overseas goods with Customs when a Chinese buyer makes a deal, so tariff collection and other procedures are faster. Under Guangzhou's system, Chinese discount retailer Vip.com completed Customs clearance for 800 watches in just 40 minutes. On Nov. 11, the 22nd Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' Meeting in Beijing supported the trade with the APEC Cross Border E-Commerce Innovation and Development Initiative."

The following are some basic facts about the Macao SAR: China officially resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Macao on Dec. 20, 1999, when the Macao SAR was established and the SAR's constitutional document, the Basic Law, came into force on the same day. The Basic Law lays down a political and administrative framework of the Macao SAR. Under the principles of ""one country, two systems"" and ""Macao people governing Macao,"" the SAR exercises a high degree of autonomy in line with the Basic Law. Due to land reclamation along its coastline, Macao has grown in land area from 23.8 square km in 1999 to 31.3 square km. Macao has a population of over 630,000, with a population density of 18,900 per square km, and the northern part of the SAR is one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Though a small economy, Macao pursues an open economic policy. It has one of the lowest tax regimes in the Asia Pacific region. In addition, as a free port and a separate tariff zone, which has no foreign exchange controls, Macao is also an active player in the regional economy. Firstly legalized in the mid-19th century, Macao's casino gaming has developed a very close relationship with the tourism industry and become a pillar of local economy. In 2002, the government of the Macao SAR liberalized the gaming industry, bringing new momentum to Macao's gaming sector and the entire economy. With the influx of foreign direct investment in the sector, the gross revenues of Macao's gaming industry increased to 361.87 billion patacas (45.33 billion U.S. dollars) in 2013 from 14 billion patacas in 1999. Macao's gross domestic product (GDP) reached 413.47 billion patacas (51.76 billion U.S. dollars) last year from 50.27 billion patacas in 1999, with an average annual growth of 16.2 percent. The GDP per capita jumped from 15,000 U.S. dollars in 1999 to 87,000 dollars in 2013, which ranks the second highest in Asia and the fourth in the world. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has dropped from 6.3 percent upon Macao's return to China in 1999 to 1.7 percent. The average monthly income has tripled to 15,000 patacas from 4,920 patacas and the life expectancy of local citizens has risen from 80.7 years in 1999 to 85, the second longest in the world. Aside from casinos, the SAR is also a popular travel destination. The SAR recorded some 29.3 million visitor arrivals in 2013. Macao boasts the unique assimilation and co-existence of Chinese and Western cultures. The Historic Center of Macao, a collection of over 20 locations, was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, making it the 31st designated World Heritage site in China."

Liu Xin, 32, a Beijing local, has been buying products for her child from overseas websites since 2011. She has bought everything from milk powder, a stroller, and a car baby seat to feeding bottles and body lotions, all of which have been delivered to her doorstep through international shipping. ""Every mom around me knows how to shop from overseas websites for their babies. It is now a must-have life skill,"" she says. Liu is one of millions of Chinese who buy products from overseas online platforms and have them delivered to their Chinese addresses. The practice of buying overseas products is so popular it has earned the label haitao, which literally means ""ocean search"" in Chinese. In 2013, China had around 18 million haitao consumers who made transactions worth some 80 billion yuan ($13.08 billion) from foreign websites in 2013, up from 10 billion yuan in 2010, according to figures from Analysys International, a Beijing-based Internet consultancy. And the value of haitao transactions is expected to exceed 120 billion yuan this year. This year, Chinese consumers have also participated in major Western shopping sprees, including Black Friday and Christmas sales, in large numbers. The traditional method would be for Chinese consumers to place their orders on foreign websites, pay in the store's local currency and have the products shipped to a temporary address within the country where the store is based. So usually before shopping, Chinese consumers would register with an express delivery company to be allocated with a foreign address. Then the express company would take responsibility for clearing the goods through the Chinese customs and hand them over to a Chinese delivery company."

It was Macao people's adherence to the ""One country, Two systems"" policy, the efforts of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) government and the central government's support that jointly facilitated the region's leapfrog development, said Li. ""Earth-shaking changes have taken place here over the past 15 years,"" said Li, recalling the scenes he witnessed when Macao celebrated its return to the motherland in December 1999. The central government has paid much attention to Macao's development. While drafting the national socio-economic development program, the central government gave firm support for Macao to build a world tourism and leisure center and a platform for economic and trade cooperation with Portuguese-speaking countries, which Li said is a major move to help Macao readjust its economic structure and lessen its heavy dependence on the casino gaming. ""Only by diversifying the economy could Macao prevent from economic crisis,"" he said. Guided by China's 12th five-year plan for socio-economic development in 2011-2015, the SAR government strengthened urban planning and protection of historic sites, and launched the Ministerial Conference of the Forum for Economic and Trade Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries. Boosted by the triennial event, among others, trade between China and Portuguese-speaking countries surged to 130 billion U.S. dollars in 2013 from 10 billion U.S. dollars about a dozen years ago. ""Macao has played an irreplaceable role in China's cooperation with these countries,"" he said. To further boost development in Macao, the central government signed the Mainland and Macao Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) in October 2003, which has greatly promoted trade facilitation and boosted investment. Under the CEPA, the value of Macao's zero-tariff exports to the mainland reached 530 million patacas (about 66.4 million U.S. dollars) by June this year. ""The 15 years of development in Macao also proved a great success for the 'One country, Two systems' policy,"" Li added. The full implementation of the policy and Macao people's support for the Basic Law has guaranteed that Macao people govern Macao and the SAR enjoys a high degree of autonomy, he said. In the future, the central government will continue to improve the systems and mechanisms related to the implementation of the Basic Law, ensure the region's high degree of autonomy and support the SAR chief executive and government in administration according to law, said Li. ""I believe that with the joint efforts of the central government and the SAR government, Macao will enjoy sustained prosperity and social harmony,"" said Li."

It boasts one of the lowest tax regimes in the Asia Pacific region and sound financial stability. As a free port and a separate tariff zone, which has no foreign exchange controls, Macao is an active player in the regional economy and a vital link between the mainland Chinese and global markets. The Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR) has maintained rapid growth since its establishment, with its economy growing by an average of 11.9 percent in real terms in 2013. Macaoâs gross domestic product (GDP) was 413.5 billion patacas. This translates into 697,502 patacas or US$87,306 of GDP per capita â one of the highest in Asia. There was an increase in GDP of 10.2 percent in real terms during the first half of 2014. As of the end of 2013, Macaoâs fiscal reserves were 168.9 billion patacas, an increase of 68.66 billion patacas over the same period in the previous year. Macaoâs foreign reserves were 128.95 billion patacas as of the end of 2013. According to statistics provided by the Monetary Authority of Macao, as of May 2014 Macaoâs foreign reserves was 122.7 billion patacas or US$15.37 billion. Macaoâs small-scale economy is characterised by its openness and flexibility and enjoys a unique position in the regional economy. It used to be largely dependent on export trade, but the services sector is playing an increasingly bigger role as the processing industry tries to adapt itself to changing times. Macao is one of two international free ports in China. Goods, capital, foreign exchange and people flow freely in and out of Macao. Since the establishment of the MSAR Government, economic policy in Macao has focused primarily on protecting and streamlining its free market economic system. It has cultivated a world-recognised, free and open, fair and orderly market environment. In May 2013, the World Trade Organization (WTO) released a trade policy review of Macao, a study that takes place every six years. The report reaffirmed the openness of Macaoâs economy, with its zero-tariff policy and minimum trade and investment restrictions. It also recognised Macaoâs achievements in its service-based economy over the past six years. Meanwhile the report affirmed Macaoâs improvements in trade policies and business environment, including enhancement of the intellectual property rights system, further opening of the services industry (the telecom sector in particular), facilitation of trade (such as paperless customs clearance and increased transparency in public administration). This is the Macao SARâs third WTO trade policy review since the previous one in 2007. According to the 2014 Index of Economic Freedom released by the US-based Heritage Foundation, Macao was ranked seventh in the Asia Pacific region and ranked number 29 among 177 economies globally, and is considered a âmostly freeâ economy. Capitalising on its unique advantages, the MSAR strives to strengthen economic cooperation and develop into an international trade services platform for the region. It aims to give full play to its longstanding ties with the Asia Pacific region, the European Union, Romance language-speaking countries and especially Portuguese-speaking countries, thereby cementing its role as the bridge between mainland China and these economies."

The talks, launched two years ago, were originally planned to be finalized by the end of this year, but a variety of factors have brought the negotiations to an impasse and an agreement will probably be postponed for a year. Economic and technical issues partly account for the impasse in the talks. For instance, the focus of the latest round of negotiations was whether the three sides could agree on setting a liberalization target that can indicate the ratio of zero-tariff commodities. China and South Korea proposed a target based on their consensus, but the Japanese side turned it down, saying the ratio was too low. In addition, reluctance from the leadership is also an important reason for the stalled process. To clinch a deal on such significant three-way negotiations requires the willingness of senior officials and even top leadership, but due to widely known reasons in recent years the heads of the three countries have only met on rare occasions. Moreover, Japan's rejection of the Chinese-South Korean proposal indicates that the ongoing negotiations of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, of which Japan is a participant, may have affected Tokyo's assessment of the trilateral FTA's importance. As the three powers in East Asia, the total GDP of China, Japan and South Korea exceed $15 trillion, which accounts for 20 percent of world GDP and 90 percent of that of the region, surpassing that of the EU. But the trade volume between the three countries constitutes less than 20 percent of their total foreign trade. A China-Japan-South Korea FTA, if launched, will enable the free flow of cargo, personnel and capital, and facilitate the three countries' industrial adjustment and economic development. It will bring massive trade growth, optimize and upgrade their industrial structure, and gradually improve regional industrial division and efficiency in resource allocation. Under the current circumstances, China, Japan and South Korea are still some ways from an agreement on the FTA, but whatever difficulties there may be, it's just a matter of time before the three countries can seal the deal. They have far more agreements than differences. An enthusiastic call for an FTA by the business community in the three countries will also push governments to move negotiations forward. The world has witnessed waves of trade liberalization, investment facilitation and regional integration. Among large areas worldwide, an FTA is only absent in the East Asian region. China and South Korea concluded substantive talks for a bilateral FTA on November 10 and this will help push ahead the trilateral FTA negotiations. An FTA between China, Japan and South Korea will definitely have positive impact on their economic recovery, and the free exchange of cargo and services among the three countries will help them to enhance trust and to put aside disputes. Several sectors are expected to benefit from establishing the trilateral FTA. On top of the list is business and trade, in particular e-commerce, which has been added to the latest round of negotiations. The FTA may help bring a cross-border e-commerce market into existence. There is also logistics and transportation. With the FTA there will be an increase in regional trade volume and ports in the three countries can be expected to benefit directly since trade among them is mainly carried out by sea. Bulk commodity exchange centers and cross-border e-commerce platforms will be set up in the comprehensively bonded zones and free trade areas in the three countries. In addition, tourism, the cultural industry, and the financial sector will also be boosted by this trilateral FTA.

The US government said tires for passenger cars and light trucks produced in China were unfairly subsidized and should be subject to punitive tariffs ranging from 17.7 percent to 81.3 percent, depending on the manufacturer. Fan Rende, honorary chairman of the Beijing-based China Rubber Industry Association, said US tire makers are aware that high labor and material costs are the biggest obstacles to generate profit. The move shows that the US is adopting a tough stance on Chinaâs tire industry. The association is discussing solutions and appealing to the government to take measures to protect the interest of Chinese tire makers in the US market. âThe US move is only an attempt to further cut Chinese tire producersâ market share in the US and it could encourage other countries or regional organizations such as the European Union, Japan and India, to take similar measures to reduce their trade deficits with China,â Fan said. The highest rate will apply to tires from Shandong Yongsheng Rubber Group Co. Jiangsu-based Cooper Kenda Tire (Kunshan) Co, a joint venture by Ohio-headquartered Cooper Tire and Rubber Co and Taiwanâs Kenda Rubber Industrial Co, will face duty of 12.5 percent. GITI Tire (Fujian) Co, a subsidiary of Singaporeâs GITI Tire Corp, will be imposed tariff of 18 percent. The United Steelworkers union â which represents 850,000 workers in North America in industries that include metals, rubber, chemicals, paper, oil refining, and the service and public sectors â urged US trade officials to launch the anti-dumping and countervailing duty case against certain tires from China in June. Imports accounted for 47 percent of the US tire market in 2013, or for $10.5 billion of a total market of $22.3 billion. Chinese imports accounted for $2.3 billion, or nearly 22 percent, of the total imports, with Canada, South Korea and Japan being the other major exporting nations, according to the US International Trade Commission. Zhao Ying, a researcher at the Institute of Industrial Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, said: âMost of the Chinese exports are low-end tires and do not endanger the US industry. Chinese tire manufacturers who plan to seek legal redressal for their problems will find it an expensive affair. Small and medium-sized Chinese tire makers will lose their access to the US market because they are incapable of paying the huge duties demanded by the US government. It will also be difficult for large Chinese companies to make profits (by selling to the US market).â The US government is also set to announce preliminary findings on a related anti-dumping case for tires launched in January. If the US authorities confirm the tariffs, a process that could take six months, the Chinese government could challenge the same through the aegis of the World Trade Organization. In 2009, the United Steelworkers said a surge in Chinese tire imports from 2004 to 2008 had cost 7,000 jobs, and it sought restrictions on the imports. US government backed the move, and in September 2009, the US levied a new duty of 35 percent on tire imports, which were imposed in addition to a pre-existing 4 percent tariff.

While holding separate meetings with leaders of some Pacific island countries that have diplomatic ties with China, Xi, who is on his first state visit to Fiji, sent clear signals of enhancing bilateral friendly cooperation. China believes that all countries are equal members of the international community irrespective of their size, strength and wealth, and they should respect each other, treat each other on an equal footing and help each other with sincerity, Xi told Emanuel Mori, president of the Federated States of Micronesia. China respects the development path the Micronesian people have chosen themselves and is willing to maintain exchanges with Micronesia at different levels, Xi said. He said that China stands ready to strengthen exchanges with Micronesia on governance experience, consolidate cooperation in fishery, new energy, infrastructure construction, economy and technology, and boost people-to-people and cultural exchanges, he said. China supports the effort of Micronesia to address climate change, he added. Mori said that the Micronesia-China relationship has made considerable progress since the establishment of diplomatic ties 25 years ago, and the bilateral cooperation has greatly boosted Micronesia's economic development and people's livelihood. Micronesia will remain committed to the One China policy and hopes to enhance political, economic, people-to-people and cultural exchanges and cooperation with China, he said. Micronesia appreciates China's recent publication of post-2020 actions on climate change and thanks China for its understanding and support for small island countries' concerns, he added. While meeting with Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Sailele Malielegaoi, prime minister of the Independent State of Samoa, Xi said that China establishes strategic partnership featuring mutual respect and common development with the Pacific island countries, which also gives a clear direction for China-Samoa relations. China appreciates Samoa's firm position on the One China policy, Xi said. Samoa boasts rich resources in agriculture, fishery and tourism, and China possesses advantages in capital, technology and market, therefore, the two sides should fully tap into their potentials for cooperation, he said. China is willing to help Samoa develop clean energy and tackle climate change, he added. Tuilaepa said that the Samoa-China relationship has made steady progress on the basis of mutual trust and respect. Samoa hopes China will continue to support its nation-building and is willing to actively participate in the economic development and cooperation forum between China and the Pacific island countries, he said. During the meeting with Peter O'Neill, prime minister of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, Xi said that Papua New Guinea has the largest territory, the largest number of population and the largest potential for development among the Pacific island countries. He said that both China and Papua New Guinea are developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region and share lots of common interests. China regards Papua New Guinea as an important cooperative partner among the Pacific island countries and stands ready to expand bilateral cooperation in agriculture, forestry, fishery, infrastructure construction and energy resources, and strengthen coordination and cooperation on the Asia-Pacific affairs and the Pacific island country affairs as well. O'Neill said that China plays an important role in boosting Papua New Guinea's economic and social development, and Papua New Guinea welcomes Chinese businesses to invest in the country. China is a strategic partner of the Pacific island countries, and Papua New Guinea actively supports those countries' friendly cooperation with China, he said. While meeting Joe Natuman, prime minister of the Republic of Vanuatu, Xi said that Vanuatu is very influential among the Pacific island countries. China appreciates Vanuatu's efforts to prioritize the development of its ties with China in its foreign policy, and firmly supports Vanuatu's efforts to safeguard its own rights and interests and develop national economy, Xi said. Vanuatu has unique advantages in agriculture and fishery and China hopes Vanuatu will enlarge exports to China by taking full advantage of the zero-tariff policy offered by Chinese side, Xi said. China is willing to continue to help Vanuatu with personnel training, tackling climate change and promoting sustainable development, the president said. Natuman said that China is a true friend of the Pacific island countries and the support and assistance offered by the Chinese side to Vanuatu are very timely, adding that Vanuatu thanks China for helping train its first doctoral student in history. Not long ago, China's Peace Ark hospital ship visited Vanuatu and the staff aboard offered medical services to local people, which conveyed the friendship, Natuman said. Vanuatu hopes to cement economic, trade cooperation and people-to-people, cultural exchanges with China, he added. While meeting with Henry Puna, prime minister of the Cook Islands, Xi said that China appreciates its firm support on issues concerning China's core interests and China's major concerns. China stands ready to enhance cooperation with the Cook Islands in such areas as fishery and mining, he said. The president urged the early completion of a water supply project in the Cook Islands, which is a trilateral cooperation project of China, New Zealand and the Cook Islands, so as to let it benefit local residents. China is considering opening a Confucius Institute in the country to boost people-to-people and cultural exchanges, Xi added. Puna said that China respects and treats Cook Islands on an equal footing, and helps the country develop agriculture, build infrastructural facilities and improve people's livelihood. The Cook Islands hopes to elevate the bilateral relations to a new height and will continue to firmly support China on issues concerning Taiwan, he said. The Cook Islands also hopes China continues to support and participate in its economic and social development, and welcomes Chinese citizens for sight-seeing in the country, he added. While meeting with Siale'ataongo Tu'ivakano, prime minister of the Kingdom of Tonga, Xi said that the China-Tonga friendly exchanges date back to a long time ago, and China values its friendship with Tonga and supports its efforts to maintain domestic stability, advance economic and social reforms and promote sustainable development. He said that China is willing to deepen cooperation with Tonga in infrastructure construction, people's livelihood, personnel training and other areas, and help Tonga tackle climate change within the framework of the South-South cooperation. Tu'ivakano said that the Tonga-China relationship has made steady progress on the basis of mutual respect, and Tonga hopes to, with the assistance of China, overcome the difficulties brought by the global financial crisis, promote economic recovery and growth, and improve people's living standard. While meeting with Toke Talagi, prime minister of Niue, Xi said that the China and Niue have developed a sound relationship, and China is wiling to expand friendly exchanges with Niue, enhance cooperation in fishery, infrastructure construction and medical and health services, to help accelerate Niue's development. Talagi said that China's policies on the Pacific island countries are conducive to those countries' sustainable development and enjoy a popular support among the islands people. Niue thanks China for its positive efforts in energy conservation and emission reduction, which are substantial support for small island countries to tackle climate change. The Chinese president and the leaders of the Pacific island countries also witnessed the signing of a series of bilateral cooperation agreements. Xi arrived in Nadi Friday for a state visit to Fiji. Fiji is the last stop of his three-nation South Pacific tour, which has taken him to Australia and New Zealand."

The agreement was announced at a meeting between visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping and the leaders of the eight countries, namely Fiji Prime Minister Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, Micronesia President Emanuel Mori, Samoa Prime Minister Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Sailele Malielegaoi, Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O' Neill, Vanuatu Prime Minister Joe Natuman, The Cook Islands Prime Minister Henry Puna, Tonga Prime Minister Siale'ataonga Tu'ivakano and Niue Prime Minister Toke Talagi. All the eight island countries have established diplomatic ties with China since the 1970s. In a keynote speech delivered at the meeting, Xi expounded China's policy and measures to enhance relations with the island countries in a new era, stressing that China is a sincere friend and partner of those countries. The Chinese people and the people of the island countries have a ""natural sense of amity"" toward each other and enjoy a ""long history of friendship"" although they are geographically far apart, Xi said. Hailing the expanding common interests of China and the island countries, Xi said their friendly cooperation has entered a fast-track of development. ""China will attach more not less importance to its relations with the island countries and will make more input,"" he said. Xi said China respects the island countries' own choices of social systems and development paths in accordance with their national conditions, and support the countries' efforts to manage and decide on regional affairs in their own way as well as to participate in international affairs to safeguard their legitimate rights and interests. He urged China and the island countries to increase high-level interactions, saying that his country welcomes leaders of the countries to visit China and will work with them on top-level design for their relations. ""(We) stand ready to expand government-to-government, legislature-to-legislature and party-to-party interactions with the island countries, and will continue to advance the China-Pacific Island Countries Economic Development and Cooperation Forum and other regular dialogues,"" said the Chinese president. Referring to his proposal on the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, Xi said China sincerely hopes to share experience and achievement of development with the island countries and welcomes them to take a ride on the Chinese ""express train"" of development. China is willing to deepen cooperation with the island countries in trade, agriculture and fishery, marine industry, energy and resources, infrastructure construction and other sectors, said Xi, adding that China will offer zero-tariff preference for 97 percent of tax items imported from the least developed countries. China will continue to provide support for the island countries' major projects, infrastructure construction and projects involving people's livelihoods, Xi said. On people-to-people exchanges, the Chinese president pledged to provide the island countries with 2,000 scholarships and 5,000 slots for various studies and trainings in the next five years. China will send more medical teams to the island countries and encourage more Chinese tourists to visit the countries, he added. In the meantime, Xi said China stands ready to enhance communication with the island countries on global governance, poverty elimination, disaster reduction, food security, energy security, humanitarian aid and climate change to safeguard the common interests of all developing countries, Xi said. Xi arrived in Nadi on Friday for a state visit to Fiji after his trips to Australia and New Zealand. The leaders of the island countries said they all regard China as a sincere friend and partner as the Chinese side always respects and supports the island countries. They said China's policy and measures toward the islands countries in the new era meet the actual needs of the countries and will help the countries in their push for sustainable development. China's proposals on the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank generate important opportunities for the island countries, they noted. The leaders pledged that their countries will boost exchanges and cooperation, and cement friendship with China and will join hands with China to strive for their dreams."

The Saigon Times daily quoted sources from the Foreign Investment Agency (FIA) under the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) as saying that since early this year, South Korea has become the biggest investor among 55 countries and territories investing in Vietnam. S. Korea has registered new and expanded capital of 3.6 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 26.3 percent of the total FDI flow into Vietnam so far this year. S. Korean firms have focused on manufacturing and processing sectors, pouring more than 3 billion dollars into 271 new projects and 106 existing projects, or 83.3 percent of their total registered capital in Vietnam. Huge projects of major firms such as Samsung and LG have attracted other S. Korean spare parts suppliers into the country. In addition, other groups in the fields of trade, service and production such as Lotte, CGV, CJ and Kumho have repeatedly expanded business operations in the local market. Meanwhile, there is a strong rise in FDI capital from China's Hong Kong. Between January and October, Vietnam saw 103 newly- established and expanded projects of Hong Kong's firms with total registered capital of over 1.67 billion dollars, reported FIA. China's Hong Kong has surpassed Japan to rank third in FDI ( after Singapore), focusing on dyeing, textile and real estate sectors. For dyeing and textile, large companies such as Huafu, Texhong and TAL have strongly developed business in Vietnam in anticipation of enjoying a zero export tariff in the U.S. market. Meanwhile, Sun Wah, Warburg Pincus Fund and Texhong have strongly disbursed capital into Vietnam's real estate market which saw clear signs of recovery. From January to October, Vietnam received over 13.7 billion U.S. dollars in FDI attraction with 1,300 newly-licensed projects.

The breakthroughs were made during Chinese President Xi Jinping's ongoing state visit to Australia. China, the second largest economy in the world, and Australia, the world's No. 12, are both giants of the Asia-Pacific region politically, economically and geographically. Despite their different political systems, stages of development and cultural traditions, the pair are highly complementary in energy, resources, finance, infrastructure and agriculture. China is now Australia's largest trading partner, export market and source of imports, while Australia is China's eighth largest trading partner and an important source of raw resources. Bilateral trade has expanded 1,500-fold since the two forged formal diplomatic relations in 1972. Two-way trade reached 136.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2013, up 11.5 percent year on year. A smooth flow of materials and products between the two countries will facilitate the economic growth of the whole region and be conducive to trade, connectivity and cooperation of other Asia-Pacific economic entities. According to the results of the nine-year-long FTA talks, Australia will eventually remove tariffs on all goods imported from China, and a vast majority of Australian products will enter China tariff-free. In addition, the two sides agreed to grant each other the most favored nation status once the FTA takes effect, which will greatly lower the review thresholds for corporate investment and increase market access opportunities, predictability and transparency for such investment. The two sides also committed themselves to opening up numerous service sectors to each other with high quality. The FTA will cover more than 10 areas, including trade in goods and services, investment and trade rules, as well as such subjects as e-commerce and government procurement. On the military front, China expressed readiness to strengthen bilateral defense cooperation with Australia through high-level visits, joint drills and defense consultations to safeguard regional peace and stability. Australia agreed to strengthen cooperation with China in defense affairs and justice and law enforcement. China supports Australia in integrating itself into Asia and stands ready to increase communication and coordination with Australia under such multilateral mechanisms as the United Nations, the Group of Twenty, the East Asia Summit and the Pacific Islands Forum. The two sides also agreed to enhance cooperation in global economic governance and counter-terrorism and jointly push forward the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific process. Australia offered to take measures to simplify the visa procedures for Chinese citizens and encourage the people-to-people, cultural and educational exchanges. With China deepening domestic reforms and opening wider to the outside world and Australia speeding up its economic restructuring and industrial upgrading, their fruitful cooperation will create great opportunities for other economies in the Asia-Pacific to take a free ride on the fast-running train of development. As Xi told Asia-Pacific leaders in Beijing last week, everyone here is responsible to make the Pacific the true ocean of peace, friendship and collaboration."

Wang Shouwen, assistant minister of commerce, said during a press briefing that all negotiations will be wrapped up by the end of 2014. The agreement is expected to be signed in 2015 and take effect in the second half of 2015. The agreement will cover 17 areas, including trade in goods and services, investment and trade rules, and topics such as e-commerce and government procurement. Over 90 percent of goods traded between China and the ROK will be tariff-free, accounting for more than 85 percent of bilateral trade value. Exports from China, especially mechanical and electrical products, metalware and farm produce, will enjoy the favorable conditions, while most of ROK's industries will receive benefits, Wang said The agreement means markets of the two countries will be able to merge, allowing for further division of labor and improving competitiveness. The two sides have reached a balance between opening markets and protecting domestic industry, setting transitional period for some tariff-free products, Wand said. Two-way trade surpassed 270 billion U.S. dollars in 2013, nearly 50 times the volume in 1992, making the ROK China's sixth-largest trade partner and third-largest source of imports. One week ago Chinese President Xi Jinping and his ROK counterpart Park Geun-hye confirmed in Beijing the conclusion of substantive negotiations on the establishment of the free trade area, described by Xi as a milestone in promoting Asia-Pacific regional integration."

It is five years since Obama's previous visit to China during his first tenure. It is the second visit since their meeting in Annenberg Estate in last year. The two visits and the two meetings highlight the three major features of the Sino-U.S. relationship - coexistence of vulnerability and resistance, competition and cooperation, mutual trust and suspicion - highlighting the importance, complexity and feasibility of a new major power relationship between China and the United States. After Obama's re-election, and once the new government of China was in place, both sides determined to arrange a meeting as soon as possible. As a result, the Annenberg Estate meeting took place in Sunnylands, California. During this meeting, both sides reached an agreement on how to establish a new major power relationship between China and America, giving the prospect of a stable development in the relationship. However, the subsequent road has occasionally been rocky. In this context, the recent Xi-Obama meeting has resulted in some groundbreaking and far-reaching steps forward. For example, in the US-China Joint Announcement on Climate Change the two counties announced actions that will go beyond 2020, and they will jointly set the stage for a new climate agreement at the Paris summit in December 2015. This breakthrough was unexpected, as the two counties have been in dispute during previous international discussions. It reinvigorated global climate change discussions which had been stalemated for years. The two countries also reached an agreement on expanding the range of goods covered by the Information Technology Agreement. If the agreement is finalized, it will be the first tariff concession agreement in 19 years since the establishment of the WTO. This will boost confidence in the multilateral negotiating ability of the WTO. China and the U.S. also made active progress in other areas including investment agreements, military relations, and cooperation in the fight against corruption. In recent years, there have been setbacks in the Sino-U.S. relationship, but it has to be understood that any such relationship will obviously be sensitive, however stable things might seem, and that the path forward will never be free of obstacles. This Xi-Obama meeting has achieved surprising results such as the agreement on climate change, demonstrating that cooperation can coexist with competition between the two sides. In these visits and meetings, China focused on the principle that âThe Pacific Ocean is big enough for the U.S. and Chinaâ, while the United States emphasized the principle of âwelcome and support for a peaceful, prosperous and stable China with a greater role in worldâ. Both sides repeatedly made such statements in order to reduce strategic mutual tension. It is often said that there is a trust deficit in the Sino-U.S. relationship. With relative changes in the power balance between the two countries in recent years, both sides are highly sensitive to the strategic intentions of the other, and an action which seems entirely reasonable for one side may, in the opinion of the other, appear aggressive, restricting, or exclusive. The United States is overcautious about China's proposals for a new major power relationship. The agreement and achievements resulting from the Xi-Obama meeting show how basic mutual trust can coexist with mutual strategic suspicion. The speeches during the course of the visits and meetings show that both sides are focusing on promoting cooperation and controling divergence. This is the true essence of the Xi-Obama meetings; it demonstrates a positive attitude towards the strategic significance of the Sino-U.S. relationship.

""My company will probably sell more glucose to the Republic of Korea (ROK) after a free trade area is established,"" said Du, who is in charge of overseas sales at Shandong Shengtai Medicine Co. Ltd. The company sold glucose worth 5.6 million U.S. dollars to the ROK from May to October, more than doubling year on year. Du has read news about the proposed area on the Internet and said he is quite eager to learn more. On the sidelines of the APEC meetings in Beijing, China and the ROK jointly announced the conclusion of substantive negotiations on a free trade agreement (FTA) after 30 months of talks. The agreement will cover 17 areas, including trade in goods and services, investment and trade rules, and topics such as e-commerce and government procurement. Over 90 percent of goods traded between China and the ROK will be tariff-free, accounting for more than 85 percent of bilateral trade value. Zhang Yansheng, secretary-general of the academic committee at the National Development and Reform Commission, said there exists a high degree of interdependence between the Chinese economy and the ROK economy, and cross-border trade and investment between the two are huge. Therefore, the conditions for the free trade area are highly favorable, he said. Analysts said the free trade area will bolster business activities between the two countries and lead to peace and regional integration in the Asia-Pacific. BOON FOR BOTH Once the FTA goes into force, China will remove tariffs on merchandise worth 8.7 billion U.S. dollars imported from the ROK every year, HSBC predicted in a research note. ""The estimated long-term boost to the ROK's GDP from the bilateral FTA will be between 2.4 percent and 3.3 percent,"" said Ronald Man, an HSBC economist specializing in ROK studies. The agreement will likely raise China's GDP by between 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent, according to a joint study by experts of the two countries. China is the world's second-largest economy, and the ROK is also a major economy is East Asia. Given the size of the two, the free trade area will unlock great potential, said Li Wen, a senior researcher on Asia-Pacific and global strategy under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""Although there are no details available, I expect the FTA will streamline the declaration process at customs and cut tariffs on a wide range of products,"" said Du. He said glucose produced by his company now has one-third of the market share in the ROK, and he is optimistic about the future. Shandong Province, where Du's company is based, and other provinces near China's Bohai Bay, are reportedly vying for preferential policies to test the waters for the free trade area. BROADER INFLUENCE China, the ROK and Japan planned to set up a trilateral free trade area in 2002, but negotiations have been delayed largely by rows between China and Japan. The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Friday urged Japan to show sincerity and make concrete efforts to create a favorable atmosphere for the development of trilateral cooperation. ""A closer economic and trade relationship between China and the ROK will put pressure on Japan and likely push it to mend souring ties with China,"" said Li. More significantly, robust business activities in East Asia will contribute to peace, development and harmony in the whole region, according the researcher. ""The China-ROK FTA will help create a sound environment in China's neighborhood and ease tensions in the Asia-Pacific,"" said Li. WHEN TO IMPLEMENT According to minutes signed by China and the ROK earlier this week, negotiators from both sides will wrap up talks on ""remaining technical issues"" by the end of this year. The agreement will then be subject to parliamentary approval and other procedures in both countries before taking effect. The ROK's bilateral FTAs with the European Union and the United States took 21 months and 15 months, respectively, between signing and implementation. ""We think the Korea-China FTA will be implemented in mid-2015 at the earliest,"" HSBC predicted."

The initial framework agreement, signed on Nov. 4, 2002 in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, was designed to establish a free trade area among the 11 nations by 2010. The free trade area came into effect on Jan. 1, 2010. The ACFTA is the largest free trade area in the world in terms of population and third largest in terms of nominal GDP, trailing the European Economic Area and North American Free Trade Area. Under the free trade agreement, tariffs will be reduced to zero on 7,881 product categories, or 90 percent of imported goods. This reduction already took effect in China and the six original members of ASEAN: Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. The remaining four countries will follow suit in 2015. The average tariff rate on Chinese goods sold in ASEAN countries decreased from 12.8 percent to 0.6 percent starting Jan. 1, 2010. Meanwhile, the average tariff rate on ASEAN goods sold in China decreased from 9.8 percent to 0.1 percent. Last year, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang called for an ""upgraded version"" of the ACFTA, pledging economic and trade cooperation of ""a greater scope and higher quality."" China and ASEAN could have discussions about further lowering tariffs, cutting non-tariff measures, holding talks on a new round of service trade commitments, and promoting openness in the area of investment. China is also willing to join hands with ASEAN to advance talks of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). The Chinese premier also called for further cooperation in areas of transportation, telecommunications and energy, as well as to enhance economic and financial cooperation between China and ASEAN. China-ASEAN economic cooperation has never been more dynamic and fruitful, as China has become ASEAN's largest trading partner and ASEAN has emerged as China's third biggest trading partner with bilateral trade growing by more than 20 percent annually on average and surging by 37 times over the past two decades. The two sides are targeting their bilateral trade at 500 billion U.S. dollars by 2015 and one trillion dollars by 2020."

Xinhua compiled a list of 26 key words that highlight the fruits borne by the historic meetings. A Anti-corruption declaration APEC members have decided to adopt the Beijing Declaration on Fighting Corruption and set up a cross-border law enforcement network to strengthen transnational anti-corruption cooperation. They committed to working together against rampant corruption and deny safe haven for corrupt officials and their illicit assets in this region. B Blue ""APEC blue"" is a popular phrase coined by China's netizens to describe the blue sky in the heavily-polluted Beijing during the APEC week, which was a result of tough emission-reduction measures. The Chinese people hope to make APEC blue a ""new normal"". C Connectivity APEC leaders approved the ""APEC Connectivity Blueprint 2015-2025"" to lay the foundation for all-round connectivity in the Asia-Pacific region, involving the construction of new roads, railways and shipping lanes; the slashing of regulatory constraints; and the easing of barriers to people-to-people interaction and mobility. D Dream After advocating the China Dream, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the fulfillment of the Asia-Pacific Dream of common development, prosperity and progress. E E-commerce E-commerce and the Internet economy, a new engine for economic growth, was included in the APEC meetings' agenda for the first time. It's potential was on full display throughout China's Singles' Day, which coincided with the closure of the meeting on Nov. 11, when the online buying fiesta smashed records, with e-commerce giant Alibaba ringing-up sales of over 45 billion yuan (7.3 billion U.S. dollars) thanks to the world's biggest online retail sales day. F Fresh mission APEC leaders have defined the fresh mission for the bloc in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, which is to smash a variety of ""shackles"" to embrace a new round of grand openness, communication and integration. G Global value chains (GVCs) APEC leaders adopted a strategic blueprint for promoting GVC development and cooperation. This will help to better understand and support the ""trading tasks"" involved in adding value to cross-border final products, and contribute to the realization of a more effective policy and regulatory infrastructure for global trade. H Host This is the second time China has played host to APEC leaders in 13 years. Since the 2001 Shanghai meeting, extraordinary changes have taken place in China, now the world's second largest economy compared to the sixth back then. The meeting is set to reshape APEC and the world. I Information Technology Agreement (ITA) During the APEC meetings, the United States announced that it reached a consensus with China on resuming and finalizing negotiations on updating the World Trade Organization's ITA by including more products. It was confirmed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. The expansion of ITA has a significant commercial value, as consensus had been made upon the tariff exemption on about 200 items, involving about 2.77 trillion U.S. dollars of global trade. If an agreement is reached, it will become the first agreement on tariff cuts since the establishment of the WTO. J Japan China-Japan relations saw signs of ice-breaking improvement during the APEC meetings. A four-point principled agreement to improve bilateral ties was reached, leading to the meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Beijing.

However, ASEAN officials have recently indicated that the date of Dec. 31, 2015, should not be seen as a deadline, but an important milestone in a progressive process. Officials are drawing up a new roadmap for ASEAN community building covering a 10-year period subsequent to the current roadmap for 2009-2015. In developing the next roadmap, ASEAN leaders are poised to take into account upcoming challenges it faces in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, while continuing to work on unfinished job left over from the first roadmap, scholars told Xinhua in interviews ahead of the ASEAN summit and related meetings. ""When the AEC vision was created earlier, the world economy was quite different,"" said Kaewkamol Pitakdumrongkit, an assistant professor at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University. The ASEAN Community comprises three pillars such as the AEC, the ASEAN Political-Security Community and the ASEAN Socio- Cultural Community, led by efforts on the AEC. While it is difficult to quantify the progress, a scorecard gauging the progress released by the ASEAN Secretariat in May shows that the bloc has achieved 80 percent of the required steps. Most recently, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said at a forum that ASEAN has achieved some 85 percent of the targets set out. ASEAN may not necessarily get an honor, but it will pass the exam, he said. ASEAN has made remarkable achievements in terms of free trade of goods, with tariffs already close to zero on most of the products. The AEC vision is defined by factors, such as a single market and production base, a competitive economic region, equitable economic development and integration into the global economy. Observers said that the remaining 15 percent of the targets, though only a small part, are the hard ones, as they may involve domestic efforts. Kaewkamol said that they mainly fall into issue areas such as non-tariff barriers, services trade liberalization, investment liberalization and free flow of people, particularly skilled labor. There are also challenges arising from the changing global economic landscape. The European economy remains weak and the recovery in the United States has been slow. Meanwhile, the ever closer integration of the regional production network has been a key factor, too, Kaewkamol said. ""These immediate challenges we have to address in 10 years. I think these elements will be put into the vision beyond 2015,"" he said. Yang Razali Kassim, a senior fellow at the Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Nanyang Technological University, highlighted connectivity, consensus and ASEAN centrality as the three core issues that ASEAN leaders will have to tackle beyond 2015, with non-traditional security challenges as another key area of cooperation. ""ASEAN Centrality will consequently have to be re-emphasized to maintain ASEAN's relevance in the face of geopolitical flux,"" he said. ASEAN has been known for being a platform for cooperation in the wider region. Such cooperation, including the China-ASEAN cooperation, often works by building on consensus so that it is comfortably acceptable to all parties involved, said Mi Liang, a professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University. ""For political and security, the emphasis should be on supporting the ASEAN centrality,"" said Termsak Chalermpalanupap, leading researcher for political and security affairs at the ASEAN Studies Center of Singapore's Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. At the upcoming ASEAN summit a report is expected to be submitted by a taskforce charged with generating ideas on how to strengthen ASEAN bodies, including the ASEAN Secretariat. While consensus is important for ASEAN to stay together, the ASEAN regional cooperation will have to be driven by economic cooperation, said Oh Ei Sun, senior fellow at Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Nanyang Technological University. ASEAN has also said it sees the need to be more people-centered, largely due to the rise of non-traditional security issues, such as health security, food and energy security, as well as disaster management. These challenges provide an additional driver for regional cooperation, scholars said."

Xi hosted a private dinner for Obama at the Zhongnanhai leadership compound in central Beijing following the conclusion of the 22nd Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' Meeting. Before a bilateral meeting to exchange views on Sino-US ties and international and regional issues of mutual concern, the two heads of state took a stroll through Zhongnanhai. For many observers, the Zhongnanhai meeting called to mind the informal meeting between the two leaders at the Sunnylands estate in California in June 2013. While briefing Obama on the history of Zhongnanhai, Xi said it is important to learn about China's modern history in order to understand the Chinese people's current aspirations and the path forward they have chosen, the Xinhua News Agency reported. During the Tuesday meeting, Obama reportedly struck a positive note despite tensions in the Sino-US relationship caused by issues ranging from cybersecurity to maritime disputes in the South China Sea. ""When the US and China are able to work together effectively, the whole world benefits,"" he was quoted as saying by Reuters. Obama also added he wanted to ""take the relationship to a new level."" Earlier on Tuesday, Ben Rhodes, a US deputy national security adviser, said the US will be ""very clear"" with China if it veers beyond the bounds of international norms on cybersecurity and other issues. Despite points of tension, in a sign that they can work together, China and the US reached a breakthrough agreement on expanding the tariff-cutting Information Technology Agreement (ITA) covering more than 200 information technology products, a move which could affect $1 trillion in trade. The two countries reached a deal late Monday after marathon negotiations to expand the ITA and eliminate global tariffs on a wide range of products including medical equipment, GPS devices, video game consoles and next-generation semiconductors. The details of the agreement have yet to be disclosed. ""This is encouraging news for the US-China relationship,"" US Trade Representative Michael Froman said Tuesday. ""It shows how the US and China work together to both advance our bilateral economic agenda and support the multilateral trading system,"" he added. Froman said the move will add an estimated $190 billion to global GDP. Zha Xiaogang, a research fellow at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies, told the Global Times that the deal will not give a significant boost to Chinese trade, but will bring long-term benefits to both countries in the form of increased exports for the US and swifter technological development in China. ""When the tariffs are removed, R&D for many technology companies in China will be put under pressure due to an increase in market competitiveness. They will need to work harder to come up with better products to compete with those of foreign companies. In other words, the deal will promote research in information technology,"" he said. Zha also pointed out that the trade pact is a strategy to further stabilize the Sino-US relationship as the two countries have now become increasingly interdependent. ""The deal shows that China has stepped back. The move not only stabilizes Sino-US relations but also benefits the future of bilateral economic ties,"" he said. Zhao Zhongxiu, an international trade expert at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, told the Global Times that the trade pact is a ""gift"" to the US during the APEC meetings. Xi and Obama are scheduled to hold a second round of talks at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Wednesday. Agencies contributed to this story"

FROM GOLDEN PARTNERSHIP TO DIAMOND COOPERATION China and the 10-member ASEAN have labeled the past 10 years a ""golden decade"" for their relationship since 2003 when they forged a strategic partnership and have dubbed the next 10 years a "" diamond decade,"" which both sides hope will feature more practical cooperation and regional economic integration. China is the largest trading partner of ASEAN while ASEAN has emerged as China's third largest. Two-way trade amounted to 443.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2013, nearly six-fold that of 2003. In the first three quarters of this year, the figure reached 346.6 billion U.S. dollars, a 7.5-percent increase year-on-year. Both sides are also determined to push their trade volume to 500 billion U.S. dollars by 2015 and 1 trillion U.S. dollars by 2020. Analysts attribute the rapid development of China-ASEAN ties to their cooperation of mutual benefit and mutual respect. ""The China-ASEAN relations are characterized by mutual respect and China is not seeking a dominant role in bilateral cooperation, "" said Mi Liang, a professor at the Beijing Foreign Studies University (BFSU). ""The two sides do not attach any political strings to their economic ties."" Kaewkamol Pitakdumrongkit, an assistant professor at Singapore' s Nanyang Technological University, believed that the China-ASEAN cooperation has been doing well, such as the sub-regional development. ""China has funded much of the sub-regional development project like the Mekong,"" he said, referring to the 4,880-km Mekong river which flows from China to Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. Gong Ting, a research assistant of the China Institute of International Studies, said the call for building an even closer China-ASEAN community of common destiny and the 2+7 cooperation framework put forward by China are aimed at deepening cooperation during the past ""golden decade."" The two political consensuses chart a course of long-term development of China-ASEAN relations, while specific initiatives are mapped out in seven areas of cooperation in politics, trade and economy, inter-connectivity, finance, maritime cooperation, security as well as cultural and people-to-people exchanges. ""The initiatives are designed to broaden the converging interests between China and ASEAN countries and promote their cooperation to a new stage of the 'diamond decade,'"" Gong said. The 10-member ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. GREAT SCOPE FOR FUTURE GROWTH Last year, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang proposed upgrading a Free Trade Area between China and ASEAN, which will entail further reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers, new round of service trade talks and opening-up for mutual investment. The China-ASEAN FTA, launched in 2010, has become the largest among developing nations, covering a total population of 1.9 billion. The first talks on the upgraded version of the CAFTA were held in Hanoi, Vietnam, in September and the next round is to be hosted by China in 2015. ""China's initiative has been well responded by the ASEAN nations, which also appreciate Beijing's determination and sincerity to advance its relations with ASEAN,"" said Gong. In the future, two-way investment, major infrastructure projects, e-commerce and cross-border Chinese currency RMB transactions are likely to play a bigger role in the China-ASEAN economic ties. Chen Zhou, director of the department of Asian affairs of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, said China's business model with ASEAN has changed from exporting goods to establishing manufacturing facilities, as well as research and development centers and sales networks. ""This shift could have great business implications as it comes at a time when both sides are eager to diversify and adjust their industrial structure for exports,"" he said. Accumulated investment between China and ASEAN countries hit 123.1 billion U.S. dollars by the end of September this year, and both sides are eager to boost their mutual investment to 150 billion U.S. dollars in the years to 2020. In October, 21 Asian countries, including nine ASEAN nations, established an Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in Beijing, with a view to speeding up infrastructure in energy, power, transportation, telecommunications, as well as agricultural and urban development. ""The ASEAN countries want to use China's investment to improve their infrastructure, which will certainly consolidate the economic bond between the two sides,"" said Xiao Wunan, executive vice chairman of the Asia Pacific Exchange & Cooperation Foundation. He believed that an improved infrastructure system, such as high-speed railway, electricity and telecom networks, will further boost the transfer of technology, export of goods and movement of skilled labor in the region. RENEWED ENDEAVOR FOR WIN-WIN COOPERATION China has been trying to revitalize an ancient seaway to promote economic ties with the ASEAN nations since October 2013 when Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed the 21st century Maritime Silk Road during a visit to Indonesia. Analysts said revival of the historic trade route will inject new and strong vigor into the China-ASEAN cooperation based on common development and prosperity. ""The Maritime Silk Road initiative will have a huge and far- reaching impact on the relations between China and ASEAN countries, "" said professor Mi of the BFSU. By upgrading its cooperation with the southeast Asian regional bloc, China is also seeking to secure a negotiated solution to maritime disputes with related ASEAN countries. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China advocates a ""dual- track"" approach in resolving the South China Sea issue. The ""dual-track"" approach includes relevant disputes being addressed by countries directly involved through negotiations and in a peaceful way, and peace and stability in the South China Sea being jointly maintained by China and ASEAN countries. ""Differences are inevitable in the China-ASEAN relations, but both sides will see their economic cooperation develop in a deeper and more pragmatic way,"" said Xiao from the Asia Pacific Exchange & Cooperation Foundation. Last month, China and Vietnam agreed to properly address and control disputes after Vietnamese vessels illegally disturbed a Chinese company's drilling activities near the Xisha islands in the South China Sea in May. ""The South China Sea issue is difficult but I think it will not spill over to block trade flows with other countries and areas,"" said professor Kaewkamol of the Nanyang Technological University. Sharing a common destiny and common interests, China and the ASEAN nations are bound to further enhance their strategic partnership of cooperation in the new decade."
485,http://english.people.com.cn/n/2014/1110/c90780-8807106.html,APEC meets Beijing at crossroads,"November 10, 2014","BEIJING, Nov. 9 -- Beijing is catching global eyes as leaders of Asia-Pacific economies meet at a suburban lake resort when their regional cooperation initiative comes to a crossroads for reshaping. Hosted by Xi Jinping, the high-profile rendezvous at the Yanqi Lake, which will gather international political heavyweights including Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin, is expected to witness a proud and indelible moment in the history of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). High on the meeting's agenda are the launch of the process of a regional free trade area and promoting regional interconnectivity through infrastructure. If all goes well, the Beijing meeting will serve as another opportunity for the world's largest developing economy to make greater contributions to regional and world development. President Xi proposed an Asia-Pacific dream when addressing the APEC CEO Summit Sunday, telling over 1,500 business people that ""the development prospect of our region hinges on the decisions and actions we take today."" ""We are duty-bound to create and fulfill an Asia-Pacific dream for our people,"" Xi said. This is the second time that China has played host to APEC leaders after it joined the regional grouping in 1991. China hosted the Shanghai APEC in 2001, shortly after Beijing secured its hosting right for the 2008 Olympic Games whereas the country's entry into the World Trade Organization was just around the corner. Its aspiration of closer integration with the world and its expectations for a brighter future at the time were translated into pride and joy the whole nation felt towards the Shanghai APEC. Profound changes have since taken place - geo-politically, economically, and technologically. APEC economies now account for approximately 40 percent of the world's population, 57 percent of world GDP and 48 percent of world trade. The region is widely regarded as a global growth engine with unprecedented development potentials, while its strategic importance is being increasingly recognized. China itself has become the world's second largest economy, and it is expected to shoulder more international responsibility on the global stage. It is only natural that the quest to build a just and reasonable international order in tune with the common interests of all has now become a key undertaking for the Asia-Pacific. To do so, China has proposed to design a road-map for the launching of the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) and a blueprint for connectivity development among APEC members. The impasse in the Doha round of global multilateral trade talks gave impetus to a proliferation of smaller free trade agreements (FTAs) in the region. They brought some benefits but also unwanted troubles: different tariff schemes, complicated rules of origin, trade discrimination over countries excluded from the FTAs, to list a few. Against that backdrop, APEC economies' enthusiasm to integrate the varying and overlapping FTAs is understandable. If APEC members reach consensus on launching the FTAAP process in the upcoming economic leaders' meeting, it will lay a sound foundation for the regional free trade zone and send a heartening signal to the global free trade momentum. Meanwhile, with its enormous economic scale, APEC members are also wary of the huge gaps among them, many of which are still developing economies. Regional economic development hinges on the connectivity of the physical infrastructure, of the standards and technology, as well as of the personnel, with a major problem of being lack of funds. The good news is that 21 Asian countries, including China and India, signed an MOU to set up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank last month. China has also pledged to contribute 40 billion U.S. dollars to set up a Silk Road Fund to strengthen connectivity and improve cooperation in the country's neighborhood. The exciting prospects nonetheless invites one to look back to the past for inspiration. It has been 25 years since the APEC was established in 1989 to further enhance economic growth and prosperity for the region and to strengthen the Asia-Pacific community. Over the past two and a half decades, the young but robust grouping has thrived on openness, inclusiveness, and on its celebration of differences while seeking common grounds. China has bonded with the organization closely since its entry, thanks to their shared philosophy for cooperation and pursuit of growth and prosperity. For 23 years, APEC has offered China a broad stage for regional integration, whereas China has shared the fruits of its reform and opening-up drive with the entire Asia-Pacific and beyond. The country impressed the world during the 1997 and 2008 financial crises for bravely sharing weal and woes with other economies and taking resolute counter-measures. It has hosted hundreds of events and meetings to facilitate regional collaboration on telecommunication, mining, agriculture and science and technology. With concrete deeds and earnest efforts, China has lived up to its promise of building a community of ""common destiny"" in the Asia Pacific. Granted, there would be challenges and obstacles on the way to regional integration. But as one Chinese saying goes, ""there are no mountain higher than man could ever scale, and there are no journey longer than man could ever travel."" Indeed, hardly had anyone 25 years ago envisioned the vitality of the Pacific Rim we boast today. Beijing's endeavor to reshape the APEC initiative at a time of staggering world economic recovery - by expanding free trade and improving connectivity - will no doubt leave an indelible imprint in the course of regional cooperation and global economic development."

APEC Born in 1989, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation connects both sides of the Pacific Ocean, linking emerging economies with developed economies. APEC has made the geographical concept of ""Asia-Pacific"" into an economic cooperation group that accounts for half of the world's economy. It currently demonstrates the biggest growth vigor and potential. Bogor Goals APEC members announced the Bogor Goals in 1994, proposing the goal of forming a ""big family"" of APEC members. They promised to achieve free and open trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region no later than 2020. As it is the 20th anniversary of the Bogor Goals, people expect the APEC Beijing meeting to provide a clearer path for regional economic integration. Connectivity The APEC Beijing meeting will discuss ways to strengthen comprehensive infrastructure construction that can improve regional connections. APEC members are actively discussing an APEC connectivity blueprint that involves the connection of infrastructure, rules and people. Dialogue Dialogues play an important role at the Beijing APEC meeting. On Nov. 8, Chinese President Xi Jinping chaired and addressed a dialogue on strengthening connectivity partnership. On Nov. 10, Xi will chair the APEC Business Advisory Council Dialogue with Leaders and answer questions at the meeting. Economies The 21 APEC economies make up 40 percent of global population, 57 percent of the world's GDP, and 46 percent of the global trade. Free Trade Area of Asia-Pacific Promoting regional economic integration is a major topic of the APEC Beijing meeting. The meeting is expected to make new progress in starting building the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP). Growth All APEC economies need to drive growth through innovation and reforms. Growth is one of main topics of the APEC Beijing meeting. APEC members will discuss key fields such as economic reforms, innovation and urbanization. They will explore new momentum for regional growth. Host China is the host of the annual APEC meeting for a second time in 13 years after the 2001 APEC Shanghai meeting. China hopes the Beijing meeting will deepen Asia-Pacific economic cooperation and shape the region's future through closer partnership. Integration In promoting the FTAAP, China hopes APEC can guide and coordinate regional economic integration. China also hopes APEC can chart a roadmap for the FTAAP. Japan Chinese foreign minister and commerce minister met with their Japanese counterparts at the APEC Beijing meeting. China also calls on the Japanese side to create an ""enabling environment"" for the contact of the leaders of the two countries. Key Meetings The meetings held in Beijing between Nov. 5 and Nov. 11 are the key for this year's APEC activities. The meetings include minister-level meetings, leaders' informal meetings, a dialogue on strengthening connectivity partnership, APEC CEO Summit, and APEC Business Advisory Council Dialogue with Leaders. Leaders The leaders and representatives of the APEC member economies will get together in Beijing to attend the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting and to carry out intensive bilateral and multilateral diplomatic activities.Chinese President Xi Jinping will have a group photo taken with the leaders and representatives attending the APEC meeting. Xi will also take part in a tree planting activity that symbolizes the joint growth, development and progress of the Asia-Pacific. Made-in-China The APEC Beijing meeting will be adorned by products made in China, such as clothes, food and cars. For example, Hongqi limousine H7, the first domestic made high-end car, has been designated the official vehicle during the APEC meeting. Non-binding Principle APEC serves as a negotiation platform following a non-binding principle. APEC not only heralds the regional trade liberalization but also drives WTO to break new grounds. Obama At the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping, U.S. President Barack Obama will pay a state visit to China and attend the 22nd APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting from Nov. 10 to 12. Partnership This year's APEC meeting is under the theme ""Shaping the Future Through Asia-Pacific Partnership,"" underlining the aspiration that inclusive partnerships may be the greatest common ground APEC members can find.Analysts said the meeting will help pave the way for APEC members to bring relationships away from a zero-sum relation so that they can focus on promoting sustainable development. QE The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to end its quantitative easing (QE) stimulus while Japan's central bank unleashed an expansion of its already massive monetary easing program. The European Central Bank has also signaled plans to introduce QE to counter deflation and boost growth. How will APEC members brace for the possibly volatile capital flows ahead? Relations A new model for relations between major countries, including bilateral and multilateral relations. The APEC meeting is an important scene on the global diplomatic stage. Spouse Leaders' spouses will also attend the APEC meeting. Although details of their activities have not been released, the spouses are certain to get public attention. Transformation All APEC members need to transform growth methods, adjust structures, stabilize economy and promote reforms. During the Beijing meeting, members will conduct in-depth discussion on an array of issues such as economic reform, innovative growth and urbanization. The members will also deepen cooperation on frontier areas such as Internet and marine industries. Urbanization China advocates cooperation of urbanization at APEC. Urbanization will be an important engine driving the future prosperity of Asia-Pacific. Value Chain About 10 to 15 countries are involved in making a mobile phone. The formation of global value chain is an important sign that trade and industrial cooperation among member economies has reached a new height. The global value chain also provides new momentum for in-depth development of free trade and investment. World Attention More than 4,000 journalists have gathered in Beijing to cover the APEC meeting. The world expects the meeting to achieve tangible progress in advancing regional economic integration. The world also hopes the Asia-Pacific region to continue driving the global economic recovery. China is expected to make new contributions to reviving the Asia-Pacific region. Xi Jinping Chinese President Xi Jinping will chair and participate in a series of important meetings, including addressing the APEC CEO Summit, chairing the APEC Business Advisory Council Dialogue with Leaders and chairing the Economic Leaders' Meeting. Yanqi Lake The APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting will be held near Yanqi Lake, 50 kilometers north of Beijing's downtown area. On the Yanqi Island, a conference center, hotel, exhibition center and VIP villas all use green technologies. Altogether 3,000 bird nests have been built for bird migrations. Zero Tariff One day there may be no tariff between APEC economies with the development of the free trade area and regional connectivity. If that comes true, people may pay the same amount of money to buy an iPhone in Shanghai as they do in California."
487,http://english.people.com.cn/n/2014/1107/c90883-8806022.html,APEC's impetus lies in reshaping,"November 07, 2014","BEIJING, Nov. 7 -- When the leaders of Asia-Pacific economies sit down in Beijing next week discussing a way out for fueling the regional growth engine, they should seek a pragmatic, innovative approach of cooperation. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), a platform that groups the world's largest and fast-growing economies, should play a pivotal role in regional sustained growth as the shadow of world economic slowdown lingers on. It is time for the organization to take initiatives to reshape its framework and release more energy of regional economies. Looking back, as the European countries in the 1990s were aiming for a highly integrated community, say, the European Union, the Pacific Rim economies could but set up a loosely-organized forum to push for regional integration. The APEC, in the eyes of some people, is but a forum with a basket of non-obligatory declarations, initiatives and roadmaps, and it is a regional arrangement born to be a compromise for economically unequal Pacific Rim members. This is because the organization is a mix of both the richest countries and the poorest ones; of both the most populous continent and the sparsely populated islands; and of both the countries on the wheels and the tribes on the trees. The incredibly unbalanced economic structure resulted in a seemingly makeshift arrangement rather than a strict trade arrangement like the EU. Now, as the financially mired European Union is striving to mend its system, the Asia Pacific's wisdom has begun to pay off. Recovery in the wake of economic slowdown is picking up in the Pacific Rim, though not that solid yet. However, a gradual, flexible way in regional integration is not tantamount to a ""talk only"" tactics or even playing the closed-door ""club politics."" Since the Doha Round has stalled, a variety of bilateral or multilateral trade arrangements propped up. Compared with a unified regional cooperative agenda, however, they're rather fragmented. Some economies even tend to turn the open dialogue on free trade into a club that requires ""access card"" to better fit their own calculations, which is harmful to the regional sustained growth, especially for developing economies. Now, China has proposed the study of establishing the Free Trade Area for Asia Pacific (FTAAP), a centerpiece among the APEC's initiatives to create a broadly representative cooperative mechanism. The proposal is a promise for the shared prosperity for all the APEC members, and the path to it remains the open, pragmatic and inclusive approach by which the organization has made headway over the past 25 years. Also, an innovative cooperation concept shall be translated into the APEC framework to keep it in pace with the change of the world industry landscape. A new mechanism is in need to sharpen the region's competitive edge by lifting its profit-making ability in global industry chain. A traditional trade theory says a country that sells more gains more benefit, but now it's time to think twice. Think when you hold an iPhone. The iOS system is developed in America but the screen and cells manufactured in South Korea, and chips probably in Japan. It is Chinese workers that assemble them with home-grown phone shells, data links and protective films. Over 80 percent of Chinese mobile phones are exported and all those belongs to China's export share. It is estimated that China earns only several dollars for an iPhone that sells 200 to 300 dollars at factory price. However, most trade policies are applied only on the borders, either by tariff or non-tariff measures. China's initiative on global value chains (GVCs) is expected to provide APEC members the capacity to monitor each links of the value chain to enlarge and improve them. China has taken actions along the complicated GVCs. Now, a South Korean mobile phone manufacturer in China would meet no quota limitations if it imports parts from its own country. The APEC platform is not a closed club with one-for-all criteria. Under its framework, less developed economies need encouragement and incentives to catch up. China's large economic size and robust growth can serve as a source of confidence for APEC members. Its reform pledge and on-going economic restructuring will change its position in the value chain, while the resulting vigor and efficiency will help drive other APEC economies that are closely linked with China in the chain. In fact, only when the development gap among APEC members narrows, the APEC goal for deeper trade facilitation becomes practicable. China is willing to build more infrastructures in order to lay a physical foundation for regional prosperity. The infrastructure investment is a priority in the ""one belt and one road"" plan China launched in 2013 to promote cooperation among Asian economies. Plus, China's latest effort to improve the regional infrastructure and connectivity is the advocation of building the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The bank is widely welcomed by economies in the APEC areas. It is reasonable to believe the Beijing meetings a landmark in APEC history that will reshape the group's framework and bring sustained prosperity for the region."

In a time of global financial turmoil and instability, the 22nd APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, themed ""Shaping the Future Through Asia-Pacific Partnership"", will discuss major topics including regional economic integration, innovation and economic reform and growth, as well as infrastructure and connectivity. The agenda, rather than being ""tailor-made for China"" to address Beijing's own priority concerns, as was accused by some Western critics, meets the common demand of all APEC economies. It was on the basis of democratic, transparent and thorough consultations that they were decided. For a region faced with slower economic growth and a proliferation of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), an in-depth look into those topics is imperative. Seeking to promote free trade and economic cooperation throughout the whole Pacific Rim, APEC now has a significant and far-reaching relevance to the economic landscape of the Asia-Pacific and beyond. The importance of the regional economic integration, one of the 25-year-old APEC's major missions since its birth, can never be over-exaggerated when its 21 economies account for 57 percent of the world's total GDP and half the global economic aggregate. However, the Free Trade Agreement of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP), an attempt to integrate regional cooperation mechanisms proposed nearly a decade ago, remained a mere ""vision"" until today. Despite the fact that the average tariff level in the Asia-Pacific has drastically dropped over the past two decades, the ""spaghetti bowl"" of overlapping FTAs harms trade by increasing transaction costs for business through variable tariffs, complex rules of origin and assorted bureaucratic requirements. Beijing has said that the APEC meeting this year will see the launch of the FTAAP process to turn the long-standing vision into concrete actions. A feasibility study and a road-map for the overruling free trade agreement are expected to help explore the possible interaction and coordination among other regional FTAs visions, such as the RCEP and TPP. The Asia-Pacific region, widely regarded as an engine driving global economic growth, was also where the two latest global financial crises prevailed. In the post-crisis era, the APEC meeting in Beijing will see discussions on economic reform and innovative growth. Dialogues in such frontier areas as Internet economy, urbanization and maritime economy will also be on the agenda. Reform is where the economic growth originates while innovation is the key for the growth. For APEC economies, commonly tasked with shifting growth model and fostering steady growth, an accord on promoting innovative development, economic reform and growth at the meeting will have a lasting impact on its future. With its enormous economic scale, APEC is at the same time wary of the huge gaps among its members, a majority of which are developing countries. The regional economic development hinges on the connectivity of the physical infrastructure, of the standards and technology, as well as of the personnel, with the most prominent problem being lack of funds. The latest good news is that 21 Asian countries, including China and India, signed an MOU to set up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank last month. The establishment of such a multilateral financial institution will provide a strong backing for the Asia-Pacific's infrastructure construction and, in the long run, its overall development. Profound changes have taken place - geopolitically, economically, and technologically - since 2001 when China for the first time hosted APEC events in Shanghai. Though already the world's second largest economy, China still craves a more peaceful and fairer environment which will bring benefits to itself and the entire region as their interests have never been so closely intertwined like today. China's growing presence and greater responsibility at APEC will only better benefit the Asia-Pacific community of common destiny and shared interests as a whole."

Korea, China to hold 14th FTA talks","November 03, 2014","SEOUL, Nov. 3  -- South Korea and China are set to hold the 14th round of talks for the bilateral free trade agreement ( FTA) this week to discuss and conclude the remaining issues, Seoul 's trade ministry said Monday. The supposedly last round of negotiations will be held on Thursday in Beijing, where South Korean Trade Minister Yoon Sang- jick and Chinese Minister of Commerce Gao Hucheng will meet and intensively discuss the remaining issues, according to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. The two countries had already completed negotiations on eight out of the total 22 chapters, including trade remedy, sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS), technical barriers to trade (TBT), competition, environment and e-commerce. Another eight chapters, which the two sides came close to an agreement, included customs clearance, investment, transparency, communications, rules and intellectual property rights. Goods liberalization, the core part of the FTA negotiations, was involved in the remaining six issues that the two trade ministers will intensively discuss this week to reach the FTA deal. The issues also included liberalizing service markets, non-tariff barriers, rules of origin, finance and economic cooperation. Negotiations for the bilateral trade pact gained momentum after Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Seoul and talks with South Korean President Park Geun-hye in July, when the two leaders agreed to make efforts to conclude the negotiations within this year. China and South Korea had completed the first stage of the FTA talks in September last year with a total of seven rounds of negotiations. China is South Korea's No.1 trading partner, largest export destination and import source, and No.1 destination of overseas investment. South Korea is China's third-largest trading partner. Trade between the two countries surpassed 270 billion dollars in 2013, an annual increase of 7 percent and equaling to South Korea' s trade volume with the United States and Japan combined."

According to the decree, a discount of 100 U.S. dollars will apply if the price for 1,000 cubic meters of gas stands at 333.3 U. S. dollars and more, otherwise the discount will form 30 percent of the price. ""The signed decree prescribes, from November 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015, a special procedure for calculating the export tariff rates depending on the contract price for natural gas delivered from the territory of the Russian Federation to the territory of Ukraine,"" RIA Novosti news agency quoted the decree as saying. Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said later that the company is ready to start supply gas to Ukraine if Ukrainian state-run energy firm Naftogaz fulfills its commitments according to the protocol signed in Brussels on Thursday. According to the 4.6-billion-U.S.-dollar pact, Ukraine will receive gas from Russia starting from November 2014 through the end of March 2015 on the prepayment basis. Kiev will pay Moscow its 3.1-billion-dollar gas debt in two tranches by the end of the current year to resume gas deliveries. The price of Russian gas for the ""winter package"" will be established in accordance with the existing contract, taking into account the discount of 100 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk on Friday instructed the country's finance ministry, the national bank and Naftogaz to start paying for Russian gas deliveries."

""Labor-intensive industries are likely to move to the ASEAN economies in the coming years, driven by lower wages in the region,"" Li Wei, a China economist with Standard Chartered Bank, said in a briefing on China-ASEAN trade on Thursday. According to Li, ASEAN economies such as Thailand, Vietnam and Laos, which have an annual per capita GDP less than 6,000 U.S. dollars, will likely become the destination for low value-added, labor-intensive industries from China. ""Labor-intensive jobs are leaving China for sure. If it's not going to ASEAN, it's going somewhere else."" Li said. The trend of low-end manufacturing relayed from China to ASEAN economies will also create new opportunities for bilateral trade and investments. The group of ten Southeast Asian economies has been China's third-largest trading partner for four consecutive years, with double-digit trade growth in the past decade. Chinese leaders set an ambitious goal this year to bring trade with ASEAN to 1 trillion U.S. dollars by the end of this decade. However, growth of bilateral trade has moderated to six percent during the first nine months of this year, China's customs statistics show, triggering fears that regional tension and political instability in some ASEAN nations have weighed on the economic relationship with China. Yet at six percent, the number still came in better than the 1.8-percent year-on-year growth for China's trade with the rest of the world. According to the China-ASEAN Business Council, machinery, rubber, steel and textile products account for the majority of trade between China and ASEAN. ""Growth will continue to moderate if China and ASEAN continue to trade the way they have done in the past decade. Only a new production network connecting China and ASEAN countries on a deeper level will give bilateral trade a renewed boost,"" said Wang Yuzhu, a researcher with the National Institute of International Strategy under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think tank. Infrastructure, resources, and labor-intensive industries are areas where China and ASEAN nations will see increasing cooperation in the future, Wang said, adding that governments should work to eliminate non-tariff barriers and expand market access to each other. China has also pledged greater engagement in the Mekong River Basin as countries such as Myanmar and Cambodia embrace a more open economy. This will unleash demand for infrastructure and consumption as income levels rise with the arrival of more manufacturing jobs in the region. ""I think there is a lot of China potential investment coming into Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Myanmar, and a lot of it is construction and infrastructure, really areas China has a lot of expertise in,"" said Lyn Kok, Standard Chartered Bank's Thailand & Greater Mekong CEO. While economies in the region have traditionally been vulnerable to political tensions, Kok said their impact on the economy is limited. ""There is this image of lots of political protests and [the] military coup in Thailand, but [the] political situation of the country is delinked from business opportunities. It is a very resilient economy and the impact on the economy is mainly external factors, not political."" China is also looking to ASEAN economies to promote the global use of its currency, the Renminbi, or yuan. Singapore, an ASEAN economy, is also one of the fastest-growing offshore yuan hubs, with 200 billion yuan in deposits as of the end of the first quarter this year. Meanwhile, China's central bank has a currency swap line totaling at least 500 billion yuan with major economies in the bloc. ""As China investment into the region ramps up, there will be increased demand for financing tools, which could be an opportunity to push for the yuan's wider acceptance in the region,"" Standard Chartered economist Li said. China's direct investment into ASEAN economies hit 5.74 billion dollars last year and 3.56 billion during the first half of this year. Kok also cited a Standard Chartered survey of ASEAN companies showing the Chinese yuan has grown into a popular investment currency in the region, with more than 70 percent of respondents saying they used yuan-denominated investment products."

China has kept the same sugar import quota according to the World Trade Organization rules since 2004, even after becoming the world's major sugar consumer in recent years. According to the MOC, 70 percent of the quota will be assigned to state-owned traders. Imports by companies with quota licenses are subject to a favorable tariff of 15 percent, while importers without a quota license will face a minimum duty of 50 percent. Customs data showed China's sugar import volume has been growing since 2011, reaching 2.92 million tonnes in 2011, 3.75 million tonnes in 2012 and 4.55 million tonnes last year. Imports last year were equal to about one-third of domestic sugar output."

Key to stimulating FDI in both directions will be the EU-China investment agreement, which is currently being negotiated. The strong links between trade and investment mean that negotiations on an investment treaty will include market access, a key European demand. The EU wants assurances on the dismantling of non tariff barriers, or what happens ""behind the border."" As such, the talks will be difficult, a report from EU-China think tank Friends of Europe said. The EU side stresses that foreign investment brings know-how, expertise and the competition that will boost the productivity of China's companies. Investment abroad by Chinese companies, particularly in competitive markets like the EU, also helps them become more efficient and effective. ""The EU-China investment relationship is already strengthening, but there is considerable room for improvement,"" outgoing EU Commissioner for Trade Karel De Gucht told the conference. He noted that Europe's investments in China add up to less than roughly 2 percent of its total investments abroad. However, over the two days, a number of Chinese participants expressed the view that anti-dumping cases launched by the EU under De Gucht have often looked like protectionism. They pointed to the cases of both solar panels and mobile phones, and stated that there was strong demand for high quality but low priced imports in Europe. There was a strong environment theme at the Summit, and clearly many European companies see a role for themselves in developing clean and efficient energy solutions for China. Europe takes a global lead in advanced manufacturing, new energy and energy saving and environmental protection, in addition to solar energy, wind power and nuclear power. China and Europe could integrate each other's strengths in a well organised way, thus realizing sustainable development with mutual benefits and interests. There were also calls for more cooperation on high tech manufacturing, known as Industry 4.0. With regard to the environment, the European Parliament will be watching closely to ensure that the EU Commission presses ahead with sustainability chapter while negotiating the investment agreement. Martin Schulz, President of the European Parliament, said that the role of China was central to progress on environmental issues. ""The work taking place through our bilateral cooperation on climate change is also of note. But, more than anything else, it is crucial to have strong cooperation in view of the Climate Summit in Paris late next year. China's positive engagement is decisive for the Summit's success,"" he said. ""China will be at the top of my foreign policy agenda throughout my mandate as President of the European Parliament,"" said Schulz. Outside of manufactured goods, opening the China market up to European service sector companies is a priority. This includes financial services. A report from the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS), says that a precondition for a rebalancing towards consumption is a more liberalised financial system. MERICS argues that opening up the finance sector to foreign companies will contribute to a more efficient allocation of capital. The overall theme for the conference was one of the need for cooperation, and the opportunities that will result from more market openness and increased investment flows. Li Yizhong from the China Federation of Industrial Economics, said that it was important for China and the EU to commit themselves to greater cooperation, and shift from the trade-dominant structure to one which places more of an equal emphasis upon trade and investment. ""Europe, known for high-end manufacturing and R&D strength, calls for more capital in its economic recovery,"" said Li. ""Meanwhile, China boasts of a huge foreign reserve and vast market with great potential and its enterprises are stepping up their globalisation process."" President of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Fritz Horst Melsheimer, stressed the need to promote free trade and avoid protectionism. ""We will not solve these problems if we create additional barriers to trade, we need more trade with China, not less,"" said Melsheimer."

Chinese buyers have long been known for splurging in overseas shops, but it is becoming more and more common for the country's Internet users to snap up foreign goods with a few mouse clicks. Thus, reforms are needed. On Wednesday, customs in south China's Guangzhou City launched a new direct purchase model that smoothes customs procedures for overseas purchases in the country's latest effort to promote foreign trade through e-commerce. The new initiative allows e-commerce companies to simultaneously register overseas orders with customs, so tariff collection and other procedures can be sped up as the goods go through clearing. It also promises no tariffs except for tax levied on imported parcels. Compared with overseas purchases via transfer companies or domestic agents, the new model promises quicker delivery and less hassle for Chinese consumers. For e-commerce operators and the global market, it smells of business boon. ""It will bring new opportunities to Chinese cross-border e-commerce companies and also boost China's imports,"" said Luo Shuang with Vip.com, a Chinese discount retailer. On Wednesday, the company finished customs procedures for 800 watches in just 40 minutes. Though buying from overseas is popular in China, the practice is beset by irregularities and legal problems, and the trade has long wished for a more transparent and regulated transaction model, Luo told Xinhua. ""After the grey areas are cleared, Chinese consumers' satisfaction with cross-border online shopping will see a significant rise, and so will their demand for global brands and quality goods,"" she said. SHOPPING ONLINE, AND OVERSEAS China's e-commerce sector has attracted global attention for its sheer size and huge potential. Its online retail volume increased by 41 percent year on year to 1.85 trillion yuan (301.5 billion U.S. dollars) in 2013, making China the world's largest e-retailing market, according to the Ministry of Commerce. In August, Amazon announced plans to open a cross-border e-commerce service in China to connect Chinese shoppers to its global sales network. The move targets Chinese consumers' hunger for foreign goods that are unavailable or exorbitantly priced in China, as well as their complaints of difficulties in such transactions. Consumers who place orders on Amazon and eBay must wait weeks for parcels to arrive. Some resort to China-based agents for faster delivery but worry about their goods' authenticity and difficult access to after-sale service. The new customs model is part of broader customs reform in China to promote foreign trade. In May, the State Council issued a guideline that promised measures to facilitate cross-border e-commerce transactions. China last year also allowed e-commerce companies to import goods via the country's bonded areas to reduce tax. The new direct purchase model boasts more categories for consumers to select without having to import and stockpile them in bonded areas first. ""From last year's bonded area imports to direct purchase imports, it's clear that China is using cross-border e-commerce as an important tool to boost foreign trade and adjust the economic structure,"" said Lai Shujia, vice head of Guangzhou customs."

The report quoted Ambassador Franz Jessen, head of the Delegation of the European Union to Vietnam, as saying that negotiators at the next round of negotiations in Da Nang will seek ways to do away with outstanding differences. Local media revealed that geographic indication and government procurement are among the main challenges. Vietnam's apparel may enjoy FTA preferential tariffs in the EU market only if it is made from local materials or those from EU nations. The EU official said the FTA would cut at least 90 percent of tariff lines on Vietnamese exports and this promises a great opportunity for Vietnamese businesses to further penetrate into the EU market. Statistics from the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) showed that Vietnam exports to the EU represent around 20 percent of its outbound sales. Only 40 percent of these exports are tax free or subject to low duties (owing to the EU's unilateral preferences under GSP) while the remaining 60 percent are entitled to ordinary import duties (MFN). Every year, Vietnamese producers could have saved 150 million euros (194.16 million U.S. dollars) for footwear and 180 million euros (233 million U.S. dollars) for textile products in each of the past three years (2011-2013) if a FTA had been in place. Under the current GSP system, Vietnamese footwear products are subject to import duties of 3.5-4 percent and textile products to 9.6 percent during pre-2014. European pharmaceutical producers currently pay import duties of 5 percent to 8 percent for their exports to Vietnam. They would have saved nearly 60 million euros (77.6 million U.S. dollars) for their exports to Vietnam in 2013 if a zero duty had been applied. As for telecommunication and distribution, Vietnam has already opened the sectors under the ASEAN FTA or other bilateral trade and investment deals. Therefore, the country has no reason to restrict market access for EU investors, said the EU official. The forthcoming FTA will push necessary reforms in Vietnam and contribute to a more stable and predictable environment if it is implemented properly, and this will in return help boost foreign direct investment (FDI) flows, technology transfer and know-how sharing, according to the EU official."

The Australian newspaper reported on Monday that the agreement could be finalized around the time of the G20 meeting in Brisbane in November when Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Chinese President Xi Jinping are due to meet twice that month. They are scheduled to meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co- operation Forum in Beijing and later in Australia, where Xi will attend the G20 and address parliament. Trade Minister Andrew Robb told The Australian that after almost a decade of negotiations he believed there was sufficient political will on both sides to finally conclude a free-trade agreement. But there were no guarantees and he described the final stages of any trade negotiation as always the toughest. Robb said Monday that ""solid progress"" had been made at formal negotiations at the start of this month when Xi visited Australia. Further delays to an FTA with China would result in Australian dairy exports losing more vital ground to key competitor New Zealand, said Robb. Australia continues to push to cut barriers to entry to the Chinese market for agriculture and services. China wants improved investment access, tariff reductions on household items such as electronics, and gains on people movements to Australia. Australia will offer China the same 970-million-U.S.dollar foreign-investment screening threshold for private investment as that given to South Korea, Japan, the U.S. and New Zealand. The Australian reported that the same 13.5-million-U.S.dollar threshold will apply to investment in agricultural land, and 48 million U.S. dollars for agribusiness, as was included in the Japanese and South Korean deals. However, one of Australia's most senior bankers, Westpac's Rob Whitfield, warned on Monday that Australia could lose some of its competitive advantages over the rest of the world if it made too many concessions to China in any free-trade agreement. Whitfield, who was in China for the World Economic Forum, said the Coalition government should be flexible in its negotiations over the deal because of its size and complexity, despite setting an election promise to speed up the signing of the agreement. ""I think we should compromise and recognize our place in the larger sphere, but we should not do it to the point to just get a deal done,"" Whitfield said. ""It has taken nine years; you don't need to give away the farm."" With the New Zealand dairy industry increasing its revenue by 3. 3 billion U.S. dollars to the end of last year, since completing its free-trade agreement and improving dairy access, compared with a 156-million-U.S.dollar increase for Australian dairy farmers, the government has been facing calls from the National Farmers Federation, and other groups, to secure significant gains in agricultural access. ""If the government is serious about agriculture being a pillar of the economy, and if in fact agriculture is a core reason why governments complete trade agreements, then the results will be in the China pudding,"" National Farmers Federation President Brent Finlay said. Robb is expected to tell the Dairy Australian Investment Forum in Melbourne on Monday that Australian dairy exports are approaching a value of 450 million U.S. dollars and dairy is Australia's strongest growth market in China."

Chinese and foreign e-commerce insiders gathered at the China International Fair for Investment and Trade, which runs Sept. 8 to 11 in Xiamen, Fujian Province, to discuss challenges to cross-border online retail. China is the world's largest online retail market, with a total revenue expected to reach 3.1 trillion yuan (502.4 billion U.S. dollars) in 2014, according to data from the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT). Many of 332 million online shoppers, among the total Chinese population, have higher income, better computer knowledge and more fashion-sensitive. ""E-commerce in China is entering a golden era,"" said Cai Hua, co-founder of the Global Cross-border E-commerce Association who has 12 years of experience managing three foreign e-commerce platforms. GOLD RUSH Cai's optimism was shared by Nigel Sims, director at a British company Union Jack Marketing, which provides logistics and support for e-commerce businesses in the United Kingdom. ""I'm establishing an online platform in China next year, because China is a very exciting market,"" Sims told Xinhua, adding that he plans to sell brands Chinese people are not quite familiar with. ""Mostly smaller and specialized brands,"" he said. ""Not everyone can afford a French handbag or an Italian suit."" Sims's company is just a drop in the ocean of foreign businesses looking to access the Chinese market through e-commerce, said Stephen Phillips, chief executive of the China-Britain Business Council (CBBC). UK Trade and Investment signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the e-commerce giant Alibaba during British Prime Minister David Cameron's visit to China last year to help raise the profile of British companies among Alibaba's huge user base. Last month, fashion retailers Top Shop and Miss Selfridge announced partnerships with Shangpin.com in hopes of reaching Chinese customers. So far, over 20 British brands have established flagship stores on China's major business-to-customer platforms. At the same time, a growing number of foreign online retailers, such as Mothercare and Wiggle, are now running Chinese language websites. Along with foreign big names ""looking east,"" Chinese e-commerce companies have already started targeting overseas customers. Lightinthebox.com is a Beijing-headquartered retail website that sells and delivers products directly to consumers around the world. More than 90 percent of the company's revenue comes from overseas sales. Lightinthebox Vice President Jiang Yong said the company has built warehouses overseas and hired locals for after-sale services. ""Customers around the world can easily buy high-quality, low-price products on our website,"" Jiang said. ""Chinese products are competitive, as the production costs in China are still well below Western levels,"" said Li Yansheng, senior vice president of Shenzhen 4PX Information Technology Co., Ltd., which specializes in helping foreign e-retailers set up platforms in China. Moreover, China's middle class families have enough money to buy European-made products and luxuries, said Li, making e-commerce between China and the rest of the world profitable. CHALLENGES REMAIN Prospects for cross-border e-commerce may be bright, but insiders warned much should be done to tap the market's full potential. Building a presence in foreign e-commerce markets typically requires trusted local partners for technical and logistics support. ""England is a small country, which means it is easier to move things around on the same day or next day. Obviously, in China it's more difficult given longer distances,"" Sims said. Conference attendees said cross-border shipments require cooperation between the two countries' customs, tariff reductions and other preferential policies to help the industry thrive. Phillips said tastes, preferences and buying habits vary among customers in China and the West, which means foreign companies must localize product offerings and marketing. ""But our view at the CBBC is that these challenges can be overcome,"" said Phillips. Cai is also confident, while his association begins training business professionals in cross-border e-commerce. ""The cake is big enough for domestic and foreign companies to share,"" he said."

The Chinese vice primer and Jan Hamacek, Chair of the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, attended the closing ceremony. Upon conclusion of the two-day meeting, a series of cooperation documents were signed. Addressing the ceremony, Zhang announced that the third China-CEEC Local Leaders' Meeting will be held in Hebei Province, China, adding that the Chinese government will offer all necessary help for the meeting. SINO-CZECH RELATIONS UPGRADED During his stay here from Wednesday to Friday, the Chinese vice premier held talks with Czech President Milos Zeman and Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka on further advancing bilateral ties and China-Europe relations. In his meeting with Zeman, Zhang conveyed Chinese President Xi Jinping's greetings to Zeman. He said that on the basis of deepening mutual understanding and trust, Sino-Czech friendly relations and mutually beneficial cooperation will enter a new era of growth. Noting that the Czech Republic was one of the first countries that recognized the new China founded in 1949, Zhang said Sino-Czech relations remain showing huge potential as both sides cherish strong motivation for cooperation in the fields of, among others, trade, investment, agriculture, technology, medical services, infrastructure and tourism. Zhang said the Chinese government encourages domestic companies to invest in the Czech Republic and will work with the Czech government to create favorable environment for and actively promote cooperation between the two countries' companies. Stressing Czech-Chinese relations have seen new opportunities of further growth as bilateral practical cooperation continued to make progress, Zeman said the Czech Republic is ready to work with China to further tap into the potential and expand the area of bilateral cooperation and expects more investment from Chinese companies. Zeman pledged to use the platform of ""16 plus 1 cooperation"" to advance cooperation between China and the CEEC and other countries of the European Union. Zhang's visit to the Czech Republic, the first of its kind by a senior Chinese leader in nearly five years, took place on the occasion when the two countries are marking the 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. Sino-Czech relations have been picking up steam since President Xi met with Zeman in Sochi, Russia, in February when the two leaders were in the Russian resort for the Winter Olympics opening ceremony. During the meeting, Xi said both countries should take the 65th anniversary of the forging of diplomatic ties as an opportunity to bring bilateral relations to a higher level."

Deng Xiaoping realized the solution to escape lay not in tightening border security but in improving the economy of Guangdong, a forerunner of China's reform and opening-up. It was a summer night in 1958 when 16-year-old Tang Chi-yan ran away from home with another man from the same village. They were bound for Hong Kong where they hoped to begin a new life. Crossing the border on Ng Tung Shan mountain, linking Shenzhen in Guangdong province with Hong Kong, was one of the toughest things they'd ever done. But it was Tang's only hope. His father belonged to the hated ""landlord class"", so Tang, having completed middle school, was banned from further education. There was no way back. Anyone renouncing the socialist motherland and seeking shelter in the capitalist colony was considered a ""traitor"" by the government. Failure meant imprisonment or death - being caught by the border police, falling off a cliff coming over the mountains. Tang did not realize he was a pioneer among what was to become a large group of escapees. Between the 1950s and 1980s, forced by hunger and poverty, about a million people risked life and limb to make their way into Hong Kong from the mainland. Many were swallowed up by the sea; some were shot dead by mainland border police; others were just too weak to make it to safety. The situation was reported to Deng Xiaoping during a visit to Guangdong in 1977. He realized the solution lay not in tightening border security but in improving Guangdong's economy and people's standard of living. Encouraged by the open-minded leader, the Guangdong provincial government set up an export processing zone in Bao'an county to where materials could be imported, items manufactured and then exported without tariff or other restrictions. Deng supported the experiment and, when talking to Guangdong leaders, he said: ""(the Party) has no money so we will give you a policy that allows you to charge ahead and cut through your own difficult road"". The export processing zone became the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in 1980. The once poor, backward village had turned into a front runner in China's reform and opening-up. Today, with the rapid development of the local economy, escaping to Hong Kong has become a distant memory. Shenzhen is now welcoming increasing numbers of Hong Kong residents to settle and explore more opportunities in the city."

""The conclusion was drawn as the rice tariffication is the best, inevitable option for the rice industry's future,"" Lee Dong-phil, minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, told reporters after deciding on it during the economy ministers' meeting. Lee vowed to protect the country's rice industry by imposing the highest possible rate of tariffs, probably 300-500 percent, on imported rice within the permissible range of the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement. The minister also promised to prevent an excessive import of foreign rice in advance by levying special safeguard on it. Under the government schedules, the South Korean rice market will be opened completely from Jan. 1 in 2015.

The government is proceeding with the trade case petition filed on June 3 by United Steelworkers (USW) against imports from China of passenger vehicle and light truck tires (PVLT), Leo W. Gerard, international president of USW, said in a statement released on the website of USW. The next step is the US International Trade Commission (USITC) preliminary injury determination, which is scheduled to vote on the trade cases on Tuesday, the statement said. After the USW filed the trade case, the China Rubber Industry Association (CRIA) said in a statement posted on its website on June 16 that it is firmly against the filing and it will demand the Chinese government launch counterÂ­measures if the case is proceeded. CRIA said on its website that it is organizing Chinese enterprises to prepare a defense that Chinese tire exports did not damage the US tire industry. China's Ministry of Commerce could not be reached for comment by press time. The World Trade Organization ruled on July 7 that the US had acted inconsistently with WTO rules with regard to its countervailing and anti-dumping measures on certain products from China, ranging from photovoltaic cells to tubular goods, media reports said. ""China's economic growth during the world economy recovery is outstanding, therefore sometimes it is unreasonably blamed for taking jobs from other countries,"" Su Peng, an analyst with Shangdong-based industry research agency SCI, told the Global Times Wednesday. However, China mainly exports middle- and low-end tires to overseas markets and these products are not competing with the high-end tires manufactured in the US, Su said. Su noted that the statistics also showed that during the period from 2009 to 2012 when Chinese tire exports were charged high tariffs in the US, tire makers in the US did not win a greater share in their domestic market. Back in April 2009, the USW filed a similar complaint with the USITC and the USITC's investigation resulted in punitive tariffs on tire imports from China for a three-year period - 35 percent special tariff in 2009, 30 percent special tariff in 2010 and 25 percent tariff in 2012. In September 2009, President Obama approved a special tariff on tires imported from China. US tire makers took a 56 percent share in their domestic market in 2012 but the figure dropped to 45 percent so far, while the share of Chinese producers in the US market jumped from 8 percent in 2012 to 12 percent so far, auto news portal cnautonews.com reported on July 1. If the US imposes punitive tariffs on China tire exports, Chinese enterprises are not the only victims because about half of the enterprises that would be impacted by the tariff are joint ventures in China, according to Su. But foreign companies can resort to their factories outside of the Chinese market while Chinese companies will suffer the most, he noted. If the investigation finally leads to 60.15 percent and 25.73 percent punitive tariffs, on anti-dumping and countervailing respectively, as the USW's filing required, it will be impossible for Chinese PVLTs to be exported to the US, according to CRIA. Once the investigation is launched, Chinese tire makers should cooperate with the investigation and hold on to all evidence that shows they are not involved in dumping or unfair subsidies, He Weiwen, co-director of the China-US-EU Study Center under the China Association of International Trade, told the Global Times Wednesday. Industry associations also should try to make alliances with their export partners in the US and actively participate in the investigation, he said."

They now lead the world in terms of their purchases. For example, Chinese tourists - who make up only 1% of the total passenger traffic in Heathrow airport in UK - represent about 25% of total duty-free sales. Data indicates that Chinese tourists, with their purchasing power of US$ 70 billion, have become a much sought-after 'cake' for foreign countries. Why do Chinese people love spending money abroad? The main reason is that many products in China are too expensive. These high prices stem from the tax structure in China. 95% of the country's tax revenues come from the movement of goods, while only about 5% comes from income tax. In taxation terminology, the government prefers indirect tax rather than direct tax. The main tax in western countries is personal income tax. For example, 75% of the U.S. federal government's tax revenues come from individual incomes, with the result that western people are very happy to make purchases, but very unhappy to pay personal income tax from their pockets. In contrast Chinese people with ordinary incomes don't pay too much direct tax, but spending money becomes something painful. Specifically, for every dollar of goods we will pay 17% VAT. After entering the mall, we still have to pay an additional 5 to 10% in sales tax. The duties on many imported products exceed 30%. The tariff for some products, such as tobacco, alcohol, cosmetics and luxury products, is higher than 50%. This is why Chinese choose to spend money outside of China. The second reason for high prices is the low efficiency of China's logistics and retail system. China is improving the situation by reducing logistics costs and sales costs through e-commerce. China has improved the quality of its products, but because of high taxes, the internal price of the goods becomes less competitive. If we want to encourage consumers to spend more at home, we must reduce taxes on the movement of goods and improve the efficiency of logistics.

""In 2013, Foton sold nearly 17,000 units of medium and heavy-duty trucks and medium to large-sized buses in Africa, accounting for about one quarter of the companyâs overseas sales in this segment,"" said Wan Xujun, deputy general manager of Fotonâs overseas division. ""Foton takes about 20 percent of medium and heavy-duty trucks exported by Chinese automakers to the African market."" Wan noted, ""About 10 percent of more than one million medium and heavy-duty trucks running on the roads in African countries are delivered by Foton."" Foton, a Beijing-based auto manufacturer established in 1996, has seen a rapid business expansion in Africa over the past 10 years. The continent is now Fotonâs second largest overseas market. Foton, which began to explore the African market in2004, has established three sales divisions in Africa, namely, Johannesburg of South Africa, Nairobi of Kenya and Algiers of Algeria. The company now has more than 20 representative offices in major African countries, including Nigeria, Algeria and Egypt. ""Africa is positioned as one of our major strategic markets with high growth potential centered on commercial vehicles,"" Wan said. ""We have invested more than US$30 million in our East Africa Production Base in Nairobi. The base has an annual production capacity of between 15,000 and 20,000 units."" The East Africa Production Base, a knock-down part factory built in 2011, has played an important role in helping Foton to integrate local resources, reduce tariff obstacles and expand the regional market. Foton is the first Chinese automaker to build a production base in the continent. ""Foton is currently building a new development base in South Africa, where the auto market is relatively mature,"" Wan said. ""In addition, the company will seek local partners for all-round cooperation, including forging joint ventures."" Foton is striving to extend its sales network into North Africa, apart from giving priority to South Africa and East Africa. According to earlier media reports, Foton has entered the Algerian market by setting up a joint venture to sell vehicles as well as offer after-sales services and distribute auto parts. Foton will officially begin its operation in Algeria in September. Since 2010, Foton has launched its business in West Africa with a focus on the Nigerian market, which has a huge demand for commercial vehicles in transporting its petroleum and petroleum products. ""We develop customized, cost-effective products that can better meet the local needs for production and transportation,"" Wan said. The company attaches great importance to the localization of its products so as to better meet the local climate conditions, terrains, driving habits and different clientsâ needs, he added. . ""Foton also offers its dealers professional technical trainings, with the aim of improving maintenance services and promoting the companyâs brand,"" he said. Foton aims to achieve long-term development in Africa through localization in the four regions. The company will expand exports from medium and heavy-duty trucks to other commercial vehicles, as well as passenger cars. (Souce: China.org.cn on)"

""There won't be any tariff on products that previously had tariff. This makes Iceland suddenly attractive for new plants and manufacturing goods for China,"" said Ossur Skarphedinsson, the Icelandic former foreign minister who signed the FTA with China on behalf of the Icelandic government. Mining companies in nearby Greenland should be interested in exporting metal to China through Iceland, according to Efla, an Iceland-based engineering consulting company which serves international companies interested in investing in Iceland. MORE INFRASTRUCTURES Bremen Ports is already developing a harbor in Finnafjordur in the northeastern part of Iceland in cooperation with local municipalities. Four companies, including United Silicon Carbide, Silicor Materials, Thorsil and PCC Silicon Metal Production Plant, are planning to build silicon plants in Iceland. United Silicon has signed a power purchase agreement with the Icelandic National Power Company Landsvirkjun. The plant will be located in Helguvik, the same location as Thorsil's Silicon Metal Plant. The German industrial group PCC Silicon will construct a new metallurgical grade silicon metal production plant in Husavik in northern Iceland. The U.S. firm Silicor Materials will start building a plant in Grundartangi in western Iceland later this year. BETTER WITH THE FTA Terry Jester, the CEO of Silicor Materials, told Xinhua that the FTA with China is one of the three reasons the company decided to come to Iceland. She mentioned the knowledge of metals work within the aluminum industry in Iceland as a second reason. ""Then the power price is also very attractive,"" Jester said. ""The FTA just makes it that much more important and that much better,"" Jester said. Silicor Materials will be producing and selling high-quality solar silicon to China. The plan is to start building the plant at the end of this year and have solar silicon for sale by the end of 2016, she said. The first large-scale plant of Silicor Materials will cost 619 million U.S. dollars with an annual production capacity of 16-19 metric tons, about 3 percent of the total solar market. CARBON FIBER PLANT IN ICELAND? Skarphedinsson believed the export of oil, gases and carbon fibers through Iceland could become attractive to China in the future, adding the FTA might increase the interest in opening a carbon fiber plant in Iceland. ""According to forecasts, China needs a lot of carbon fiber in the future. The world needs more high-quality carbon fiber. It's possible to produce it in Iceland as it's even more environmentally-friendly than solar silicon production,"" Skarphedinsson said. He pointed out a carbon fiber plant doesn't need too much electricity, and can use geothermal hot water for heating."

Following is the full text: China's Foreign Aid (2014) Information Office of the State Council The People's Republic of China July 2014, Beijing Preface I. Developing Foreign Assistance Cause Steadily II. Helping Improve People's Livelihood III. Promoting Economic and Social Development IV. Foreign Assistance under Regional Cooperation Mechanism V. Participation in International Exchanges and Cooperation Conclusion Preface China is the world's largest developing country. In its development, it has endeavored to integrate the interests of the Chinese people with people of other countries, providing assistance to the best of its ability to other developing countries within the framework of South-South cooperation to support and help other developing countries, especially the least developed countries (LDCs), to reduce poverty and improve livelihood. China has proactively promoted international development and cooperation and played a constructive role in this aspect. When providing foreign assistance, China adheres to the principles of not imposing any political conditions, not interfering in the internal affairs of the recipient countries and fully respecting their right to independently choosing their own paths and models of development. The basic principles China upholds in providing foreign assistance are mutual respect, equality, keeping promise, mutual benefits and win-win. In recent years, China's foreign assistance has kept growing. The following is an introduction of China's foreign assistance from 2010 to 2012. I. Developing Foreign Assistance Cause Steadily The scale of China's foreign assistance kept expanding from 2010 to 2012. Besides complete projects and goods and materials, which were the main forms of China's foreign assistance, technical cooperation and human resources development cooperation also saw remarkable increases. Asia and Africa were the major recipient areas of China's foreign assistance. To promote the realization of Millennium Development Goals, China directed most of its assisting funds to low-income developing countries. 1. Financial Resources for Foreign Assistance From 2010 to 2012, China appropriated in total 89.34 billion yuan (14.41 billion U.S. dollars) for foreign assistance in three types: grant (aid gratis), interest-free loan and concessional loan. Grant is mainly offered to help recipient countries build small or medium-sized social welfare projects, and to fund human resources development cooperation, technical cooperation, material assistance and emergency humanitarian aid. In the three years, China provided 32.32 billion yuan of grants, accounting for 36.2 percent of the total assistance volume. Interest-free loan is mainly used to help recipient countries construct public facilities and launch projects to improve people's livelihood. In the three years, China offered 7.26 billion yuan of interest-free loans, taking up 8.1 percent of its foreign assistance volume. Concessional loan is mainly used to help recipient countries undertake manufacturing projects and large and medium-sized infrastructure projects with economic and social benefits, or for the supply of complete plants, machinery and electronic products. In the three years, the concessional loans China provided to other countries amounted to 49.76 billion yuan, or 55.7 percent of its total assistance volume in the same period. Foreign assistance budget is put under the unified management of the Ministry of Finance in line with the budget and final accounts system. Concessional loans are raised by the Export-Import Bank of China on the market. As the loan interest is lower than the benchmark interest released by the People's Bank of China, the difference is made up by the state as financial subsidies. Graphics shows the distribution of China's foreign assistance funds according to the income level of recipient countries from 2010 to 2012, according to a white paper on China's foreign aid issued by China's Information Office of the State Council on July 10, 2014. (Xinhua/China's Information Office of the State Counci) [Figure 1: Distribution of China's Foreign Assistance Funds according to the Income Level of Recipient Countries, 2010-2012] 2. Distribution of Foreign Assistance From 2010 to 2012, China provided assistance to 121 countries, including 30 in Asia, 51 in Africa, nine in Oceania, 19 in Latin America and the Caribbean and 12 in Europe. Besides, China also provided assistance to regional organizations such as the African Union (AU).

Complete projects. In total, China undertook the construction of 580 such projects in 80 countries, with infrastructure and agriculture as the focus. Graphics shows the sectoral distribution of the complete projects from 2010 to 2012, according to a white paper on China's foreign aid issued by China's Information Office of the State Council on July 10, 2014. (Xinhua/China's Information Office of the State Counci) [Table 1: Sectoral Distribution of the Complete Projects, 2010-2012] Goods and materials. China provided 96 countries and regions with 424 batches of goods and materials, including mainly office supplies, mechanical equipment, inspection equipment, transport vehicles, articles for daily use, medicine and medical devices. Technical cooperation. China completed 170 technical cooperation projects in 61 countries and regions, mainly covering industrial production and management, agricultural planting and breeding, culture and education, sports and physical training, medical and health care, clean energy development, and planning and consultation. Human resources development cooperation. China held 1,951 training sessions for officials and technical personnel and on-the-job academic education programs in China, training a total of 49,148 people from other developing countries. Medical teams. China dispatched 55 teams composed of 3,600 medical personnel to 54 countries to provide stationed or touring medical services, treating nearly seven million patients. Volunteer programs. China sent about 7,000 young volunteers and volunteer Chinese language teachers to over 60 countries. Emergency humanitarian aid. China extended 1.5 billion yuan worth of materials and cash assistance in emergency humanitarian aid to more than 30 countries. Debt relief. China relieved nine LDCs and heavily indebted poor countries, namely, Tanzania, Zambia, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Mali, Togo, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire and Sudan, from 16 mature interest-free loans totaling 1.42 billion yuan."

Paulson calls for affirmative U.S.-China economic agenda,"July 09, 2014","Economic relationship has long been the drive and anchor of U.S.-China relationship. Bilateral cooperation not only benefits the people but also adds new momentum to the recovery of global economy. However, in the last year we have seen increasing frictions because of geopolitical reasons and the economic strength changes. Recently, Henry M. Paulson, former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Chairman of Paulson Institute, shares his observations on this issue in an interview with Peopleâs Daily. Peopleâs Daily: Since the beginning of this year, we saw more disputes in the political relationship of China-U.S. relationship, at the same time, we have seen frictions in the economic and trade side. In the context of increasing tension in bilateral political and security relation and given the recent global geopolitical changes, what do you think of the interaction between political/security tension and the economic frictions in U.S.-China bilateral relationship? Henry M. Paulson: We have growing security tensions in our relationship, and that is of considerable concern to me. So it is essential that we try to relieve these in several waysâfirst, through candid dialogue about our respective interests and views; we should not attempt to paper over our differences; second, by ensuring that our differences do not preclude cooperation in the areas where we agree; and third by working to resolve differences, where we can. But it is also important that we see productive relations among major Asian countries, and it is increasingly clear to me that security tensions in Asia stand in the way of efforts to consolidate and build on the extraordinary economic gains that have been made in the region since the 1960s. Make no mistake -- the quality of Chinaâs relations with its neighbors will affect U.S.-China relations too. These security tensions make it all the more important to thicken our economic relationship. For instance, if we are able to successfully negotiate a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) and make progress working together to meet the environmental and climate change challenge, this will enhance the relationship and provide a positive context that makes it easier to handle security tensions. Yes, we have trade tensions, but these are normal, even between mature partners. In the 1980s, Japan and the United States had trade tensions yet were close allies. The United States and Europe are also close allies and partners yet have had their share of trade tensions. These are easier to manage, a normal part of the trading system, and can be handled bilaterally or through dispute resolution mechanisms in the World Trade Organization. I do not believe we can easily wish away our security differences, so we need an affirmative agenda on the economic track more than ever. Peopleâs Daily: Economic relationship has long been the drive and anchor of U.S-China relationship. Do you think it is still true today? Some commentary says the bilateral economic tie is becoming more and more complex. How do you think of the complexity? Can you summarize some of the new characteristics which are emerging in the bilateral economic relationship? Henry M. Paulson: I certainly think it remains true and, as I said in reply to your first question, it is more important than ever that we develop an affirmative bilateral economic agenda. There are a number of changes worth noting, but the most important is the degree to which structural adjustment and economic rebalancing has become a priority in both countries. As China changes its growth model, this will create new opportunities for U.S. exporters to China, as well as new opportunities for investment. But it is essential, therefore, that U.S. firms face a level competitive playing fieldâone characterized not just by economic reform but by the introduction of genuine competition conducted according to transparent, market-based rules. Likewise, the growth of outbound direct investment from China has introduced a new dynamic to our relations. I believe investment from China in the U.S. economy, especially greenfield investment as opposed to simply purchasing U.S. Treasury securities, can have a salutary effect on our relations by supporting jobs and growth, while helping China and its firms diversify their portfolio into higher-margin industries. The U.S. needs to be transparent about the investment process and ensure that it is conducted fairly. I believe the growth of investment in both directions would introduce an especially positive new dynamic into our economic relations. And that is why I am in China this week attending events and working to promote early conclusion of a strong Bilateral Investment Treaty between our two countries. Peopleâs Daily: A statistics program by World Bank released in April predicted China is going to surpass the U.S. to be the biggest economy this year using PPP calculation. Though it is not yet a reality, many believe this represent a trend in the long term and China will overtake the U.S. in the future. How will such a tendency of China rising and finally overtaking U.S. impact trade and economic bilateral relationship? There is always cooperation and competition between the U.S. and China. But what changes do you foresee in the two aspects of cooperation and competition? Henry M. Paulson: PPP is one method of measuring economic strength and activity by computing the value of products and services consumed. But so is nominal GDPâand by that latter measure, the U.S. is and will remain a larger economy for some time. But this methodological question of GDP size is less relevant, in any case, than the more important question of whether and how the worldâs largest economies cooperate in the face of pressing challenges. There are significant headwinds facing the world economy, so it is essential that the United States, China, Japan, Europe, and other leading economies work together to support and sustain global growth, forestall future financial crises, promote trade while avoiding a slide into protectionism, and promote investment. Chinaâs growth is a fact, but it brings with it new responsibilities. China should rise to that responsibility by helping to craft solutions to these global economic challenges in partnership with the United States and others. It is essential that a rising China also rise to the expectations of its new global status."
509,http://english.people.com.cn/n/2014/0708/c90785-8752553.html,"China Focus: China, ROK accelerate FTA talks","July 08, 2014","BEIJING, July 8  -- China and the Republic of Korea (ROK) are working to ensure a breakthrough in their negotiation on a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA), likely paving the way for a larger FTA between all three leading economies in East Asia. During his first visit to the ROK last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged more efforts to accelerate the FTA negotiation so that it concludes by the end of the year, a sentiment echoed by his counterpart Park Geun-hye. If all goes well, talks lasting over two years will finally come to an end in the second half of 2014 and bilateral trade will then be boosted to the promised 300 billion U.S. dollars in 2015. Trade expert Mei Xinyu of the Ministry of Commerce said, ""The most important aspect of Xi's visit will be promoting the negotiation."" A series of cooperative documents covering trade and currency were signed in the two-day state visit, laying the foundation for the FTA. The most important of those was a memorandum of understanding between central banks of the two sides to establish a renminbi (RMB) clearing service in Seoul to facilitate trade and promote the use of RMB. Under the memorandum, direct trading of the yuan against the won, the ROK's currency, will be achieved and an 80-billion-yuan (13 billion U.S. dollars) investment quota was granted to the ROK's institutional investors to invest in China's capital market. The move marked the two sides' cooperation to deepen currency trading, which is good for the FTA, said Cai Hongbo of Beijing Normal University. Beijing and Seoul signed a currency swap agreement to bolster trade in 2008 and extended it in 2011. Ahead of the FTA, the presidents also agreed to nurture cooperation in emerging industries such as new energy, intelligent manufacturing, environmental protection and the high-tech sector. For Zhang Jianping of the foreign economic research institute at the National Development and Reform Commission, face-to-face discussion between the top leaderships will help resolve the sensitive matters that are holding things up. Since May 2012, 11 rounds of talks have been conducted between the two countries on the FTA, with consensus reached on most of the issues, such as the proportion of merchandise enjoying a zero-tariff policy. The next round of talks is scheduled for later this month in the ROK. Analysts expect that disagreements left in aspects including chemical sectors and agricultural products will be settled. China and the ROK have experienced two decades of booming bilateral trade. Two-way trade surpassed 270 billion U.S. dollars in 2013, nearly 50 times the volume in 1992, making the ROK China's sixth-largest trade partner and third-largest source of imports. As the world recovery falters, the FTA should be a profound and significant part of the two countries' future relations. It would boost trade, investment and even GDP growth of the two economies. It would help the ROK reinforce its position in the Chinese market, as its weakening technological leverage allows in U.S. and European rivals, said Mei. In 2013, around one fourth of ROK exports went to Chinese buyers, but the ratio has begun to drop. The ROK's businesses pinned their hopes on the FTA to help their products re-gather steam in the Chinese market. As for China, apart from cheaper car and electronics imports for consumers, Liaodong Peninsula, the country's closest point to the ROK, will receive the most benefits from the FTA, with Korean investment in the peninsula expected to surge. Mei said China, engaged in FTA talks around the world, expects a successful negotiation with its neighbor to set a good example for future talks. China has signed 12 free trade agreements with countries or alliances including Switzerland, New Zealand and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. HOPES OF LARGER FTA Wei Zhijiang, director of the ROK Research Institute under Sun Yat-sen University in south China's Guangdong Province, said the China-ROK FTA can push forward negotiation for a larger one that includes Japan in the plan. In May, the China-Japan-ROK agreement for promotion, facilitation and protection of investment took effect, and this is widely believed to be a prelude to the foundation of an FTA between the three countries. However, territorial and historical disputes between Japan and its two neighbors respectively have cast a shadow over the prospects. Latest evidence can be found in the shrinking direct investment from Japan to China, with the volume plunging 42.2 percent year on year during the January-May period. The FTA of the three countries was first envisioned in 2002 and the negotiation started two years ago, with the process dawdling partly due to political issues and partly due to a less interested Japan. The situation is likely to change now, however, as a China-ROK success may push Japan to be more involved or face losing the enormous Chinese market to ROK enterprises. In the first five months of 2014, investment from the ROK to China soared 87.9 percent year on year. With favorable conditions brought by the bilateral FTA, a wide range of ROK-made products from automobiles to electronics are likely to become Chinese new favorites."

As for the dispute brought by China to the world trade watchdog in 2012, the Appellate Body report, issued this afternoon, rejected the appeal requested by the U.S. and upheld China's claims with respect to double remedy, finding that the failure of U.S. Department of Commerce (USDOC) to make any duty adjustment to avoid double remedies in 25 countervailing and anti-dumping investigations initiated against China during 2006 and 2012 was inconsistent with WTO rules. The Appellate Body upheld most of China's claims in the appeal, finding that the panel, established in December 2012, erred in its interpretation of Article X:2 of the GATT 1994 and in the application of its interpretation of Article X:2 to the GPX Legislation. However, the Appellate Body was unable to complete the analysis on whether the GPX Legislation was consistent with WTO rules due to insufficient factual analysis made by the panel. China's request for consultations in September 2012 with U.S.over the latter's countervailing and anti-dumping measures on Chinese products came after the so-called GPX bill was passed to authorize the USDOC to apply countervailing duties to ""non-market economy"" countries. The bill, a remedy for the Tariff Act of 1930, overturned a previous federal court ruling that the USDOC did not have legal authority to impose countervailing duties on goods from non-market economy countries and gives an application retroactive period since November 20, 2006. China had insisted that the GPX bill would place Chinese enterprises under an uncertain legal environment and violates WTO rules on transparency and procedural justice. In November 2012, China requested the establishment of a panel to probe into the case, which was established by the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) a month later. The panel report was circulated to members in March 2014, which ruled that U.S. countervailing and anti-dumping measures were inconsistent with WTO rules but the passing the amendment to the Tariff Act was not. China and the U.S. respectively appealed to the Appellate Body in April this year over certain issues of law covered in the panel report and certain legal interpretations developed by the panel. In a statement published in the wake of WTO's final rulings, China's Ministry of Commerce (MOC) said this was a ""significant victory of China's challenge against the United States' abuse of trade remedy measures through legal channel, which is of great impact."" According to the MOC, the annual export value of products at issue exceeds 7.2 billion dollars, which involves significant trade interest of China. The ministry urged in the statement the U.S. to respect the WTO rulings and correct its wrong doings in abusing trade remedy measures, and to ensure an environment of fair competition."

Swiss officials and experts say the FTA will foster the win-win trade and economic exchange within the two sides. The FTA, signed in Beijing on July 6, 2013, after nine rounds of negotiations of more than two years, is the first free trade pact inked between China and a country in continental Europe. According to the FTA, as much as 99.7 percent of Chinese exports to Switzerland will be immediately exempted from tariffs, while 84.2 percent of Swiss exports to China will eventually receive zero tariffs. From a Swiss perspective, the FTA enables a competitive advantage compared to countries which have not a FTA with China. Noting that the vast majority of industrial and agricultural goods exported from Switzerland to China will enjoy tariff concession, either some with immediate effect or some after a period of transition, Swiss Federal Councilor Johann Schneider-Ammann on Tuesday said, ""This means that Swiss products will become considerably more competitive over the short and medium term."" ""If you ask what shall be the positive effects out of it, naturally, it is trade, and trade development on both sides,"" he added. He said, ""Switzerland is, honestly speaking, a very tiny market. We look for the huge Chinese market, but on the other side, China will find in Switzerland partners on a top technology level and innovation level."" Meanwhile, in terms of services and the protection of intellectual property under the FTA, he said it will improve the legal certainty and therefore the ability to plan, which will cut costs for Swiss businesses and open up new opportunities. Patrick Odier, chairman of the Swiss Bankers Association told Xinhua that the FTA is going to facilitate enormously the exchange of know-how, in first place it triggers the collaboration in all sectors of the industry. ""Switzerland will be beneficial in technique, construction and mechanics, and we will also have a strong improvement in the trade within the field of luxury goods and special products like chemistry,"" he noted. In the financial and banking industry, he said the FTA will bring in the two-way avenue both are looking forward to. Philippe Monnier, executive director of Greater Geneva Berne Area's Economic Development Agency also told Xinhua that the FTA will encourage bilateral trade and investment, by definition this will benefit both China and Switzerland. Besides, the Chinese consumers will enjoy the benefits of more tariff-freed Swiss products into the Chinese market, he reckoned the FTA will attract more Chinese companies and investment into Switzerland to use the country's geographical and policy advantages to conduct business in Europe. ""In our view, the most important advantage is that Chinese business people will change their perception of Switzerland,"" Monnier said. He stressed that Switzerland will no longer be seen as only a country of chocolate and cheese but also as an ideal country for international business, in particular for hosting international operations such as European headquarters. He said compared to other European countries, Switzerland is more liberal and pro-business, and many global companies choose Switzerland for their European headquarters. By taking advantages of the country's competitive taxation, outstanding in innovation, academia-industry technology transfer, he added that Chinese companies could better use Switzerland as a platform to scale up their presence in Europe."

""I am looking forward to breakthroughs in the China-ROK Free Trade Area (FTA) negotiations, tariff reductions and RMB-Korean won direct settlement,"" said Youngchul Lim, 51, a Korean who runs an electronics company in east China's Qingdao City. Qingdao Toptone Electronics was the first business wholly funded by ROK capital in China, 25 years ago. Qingdao Toptone designs and develops computer speakers for big Korean firms like Samsung and LG. Lim is transferring his assembly line to Vietnam and transforming the Qingdao plant into a research center. ""Rising labor costs have hit labor relations hard in coastal regions, forcing labor-intensive firms out,"" said Lim in fluent Chinese. With its easy cargo access to the ROK across the Yellow Sea, it was cheap labor that first attracted him to Qingdao. Skilled workers, research talent and stable business ties with Chinese firms have made him keep R&D there while everything else goes south. Lim relocated his Guangzhou factory to Vietnam two years ago, but he believes that a China-ROK FTA will give firms based in China the edge. Yong Ok Park is deputy manager of Qingdao Farest Gem & Jewelry Co. Ltd.,set up in 1993, one year after China and the ROK established diplomatic ties. ""The work force has shrunk from 1,500 to 800, but our main business will not leave China. There is nowhere in the world we could find so many skilled jewelers,"" said Park. Korean business people are hoping for early implementation of a primary stage of the FTA. ROK investors had put 57.7 billion U.S. dollars into China by April, and Chinese investment in the ROK increased to 1.2 billion U.S. dollars. Niu Linjie, head of the Korean College at Shandong University, observed how ROK investment -- once concentrated in northeast China and along the coast -- has been expanding inland. Investment in central and western regions is mostly high-tech. Samsung invested 167 million U.S. dollars in plant producing NAND flash memory chips in Xi'an in the first half of this year. POSCO-CJPC Co. Ltd. in Jilin Province, close to the Korean border, is a joint venture between a local steel firm and Pohang Iron and Steel of the ROK, one of the world's biggest steelmakers. Production began in Oct. 2012 and the business was in profit within ten months. ""That is almost unheard of. The parent companies are fully confident in the prospects of cooperation,"" said Lee Pae-ho, general manager. Niu believes both China and ROK are facing economic slow-downs. In such circumstances, Xi's visit is expected by both business communities to bring new opportunities."

According to the FTA, China will implement zero tariff on goods under 7,380 tariff numbers imported from Iceland, which accounted for 81.56 percent of China's total imports from Iceland, including its aquatic products after the agreement coming into effect. Meanwhile, Iceland will implement zero tariff on all industrial products and fishery products imported from China which accounted for 99.77 percent of the total China's exports to Iceland. After the final establishment of the FTA between China and Iceland, zero tariff shall apply to 96 percent of goods in terms of tariff number, or 100 percent in terms of trade volume. HUGE MARKET OPEN TO ICELANDIC FISHERY Adolf Gudmundsson, chairman at the Federation of Icelandic fishing vessel owners, believed the free trade agreement would be of great importance for the fishing companies in Iceland. ""China, the biggest market in the world, is opening up for Icelandic seafood products,"" Gudmundsson explained. ""The Chinese market will offer enormous opportunities for the Icelandic companies,"" he said. He added that it will of course be important that Iceland is able to offer competitive prices. ""I believe the free trade agreement will bring good fortune to both Iceland and China and strengthen the Icelandic fishing industry,"" Gudmundsson said. HEADSTART FOR ICELAND With Iceland becoming the first European country to sign a FTA with China, Orn Erlendsson, chairman at the seafood exporting company Triton, believed the deal would give a headstart to Icelandic companies in competition with other seafood exporting countries like Norway, Russia and Canada. Triton has been selling lumpfish to restaurants in China where its thick skin is regarded as a delicacy. Erlendsson said the FTA made it possible for Icelandic companies to offer very competitive prices. LOWER CONSUMER PRICES Icelandic companies import clothing and shoes from China, often through a third country. Products imported straight from China will no longer have a 15 percent tariff. Many Icelanders expect lower consumer prices as a result of the FTA, especially on products imported directly from China. Shoes manufactured in China can have 13 percent lower prices compared to earlier, according to TV channel Stod 2 in the Icelandic capital Reykjavik. INCREASED DIRECT IMPORTS Margret Sanders, chairman at the Federation of Trade and Services, welcomed the FTA, pointing out such agreements are important for small countries like Iceland. She believed Icelandic companies would be interested in exploring possibilities of increasing imports directly from China. Rumfatalagerinn is one of the biggest department stores in Iceland. Rumfatalagerinn sells furniture and textile manufactured in China and imports to Iceland through a third country. Its CEO Magnus Sigurdsson said the agreement offers great opportunities to import products directly from China. The company is now trying to find out how best to utilize the agreement to benefit Icelandic consumers. A SMALL MARKET Johannes Gunnarsson, chairman at the consumer federation in Iceland, sincerely hopes consumers will notice lower prices as a result of the FTA. ""The Icelandic domestic market is very small. I'm told that the companies have to make big orders from China so it's hard to see the FTA having a lowering effect on prices in Iceland,"" he says. The FTA has boosted other parts of the Icelandic economy. U.S. company Silicor Materials, a leading manufacturer of high-quality solar silicon, has decided to build a new silicon plant in Iceland because of the agreement. The company's CEO Terry Jester pointed out that the company made the decision to build the plant in Iceland because of cheap energy, the aluminum industry and plans to build more silicon plants in Iceland. Talking about the FTA to local media, Jester said Silicor Materials' biggest customers reside in China."

Following is the full text: The Practice of the ""One Country, Two Systems"" Policy in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Information Office of the State Council The People's Republic of China June 2014, Beijing Contents Foreword I. Hong Kong's Smooth Return to China II. Establishment of the Special Administrative Region System in Hong Kong III. Comprehensive Progress Made in Various Undertakings in the HKSAR IV. Efforts Made by the Central Government to Ensure the Prosperity and Development of the HKSAR V. Fully and Accurately Understanding and Implementing the Policy of ""One Country, Two Systems"" Conclusion Appendix Foreword ""One country, two systems"" is a basic state policy the Chinese government has adopted to realize the peaceful reunification of the country. Following this principle, the Chinese government successfully solved the question of Hong Kong through diplomatic negotiations with the British government, and resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, fulfilling the common aspiration of the Chinese people for the recovery of Hong Kong. As a result, Hong Kong got rid of colonial rule and returned to the embrace of the motherland, and embarked on the broad road of common development with the mainland, as they complemented each other's advantages. Hong Kong's return to the motherland turned ""one country, two systems"" from a scientific concept into vivid reality. The central government strictly adheres to the Basic Law of Hong Kong, earnestly performs its constitutional duties and stands firm in supporting the administration of the chief executive and the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in accordance with the law. The HKSAR exercises a high degree of autonomy in accordance with the law, and is vested with executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication. The previous capitalist system and way of life remain unchanged, and most laws continue to apply. Hong Kong continues to prosper, its society remains stable, and full development is being witnessed in all undertakings. The ""one country, two systems"" policy enjoys growing popularity in Hong Kong, winning the wholehearted support from Hong Kong compatriots as well as people in all other parts of China. It is also thought highly by the international community. ""One country, two systems"" is a new domain in which we constantly explore new possibilities and make new progress in pioneering spirit. A summary of the policy's implementation in the HKSAR, and a comprehensive and correct understanding and implementation of the policy will prove useful for safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests, for maintaining long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong, and for further promoting the ""one country, two systems"" practice along the correct track of development. I. Hong Kong's Smooth Return to China In the early 1980s, China's state leader Deng Xiaoping put forward the scientific concept known as ""one country, two systems"" in an effort to realize the peaceful reunification of China, and this ingenious design was first applied to solve the question of Hong Kong. According to Deng Xiaoping, ""one country, two systems"" means there is only but one China and under this premise the mainland adheres to the socialist system while Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan may retain their capitalist systems over a long time to come. On December 4, 1982, the Fifth Session of the Fifth National People's Congress (NPC) endorsed a new Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Its Article 31 provides, ""The state may establish special administrative regions when necessary. The systems to be instituted in special administrative regions shall be prescribed by law enacted by the National People's Congress in the light of the specific conditions."" Giving expression to the ""one country, two systems"" concept, this Article provides the constitutional basis for the establishment of special administrative regions in certain areas that adopt different social systems and different policies from those on the mainland, as the Chinese government makes efforts to realize the peaceful reunification of China. After in-depth investigations and research, the Chinese government formulated 12 basic policies regarding the question of Hong Kong, known as the ""12 Principles,"" in early 1983. The main contents were: (1) The Chinese government decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as of July 1, 1997. (2) After resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, the central government would establish a special administrative region in Hong Kong in accordance with the provisions in Article 31 of the Constitution. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region would be directly under the authority of the Central People's Government and would enjoy a high degree of autonomy. (3) The HKSAR would be vested with legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication. The laws, decrees and regulations currently in force in Hong Kong would remain basically unchanged. (4) The government of the HKSAR would be composed of local inhabitants. The principal officials would be selected by election or through consultations held locally and be appointed by the Central People's Government. Those previously working in the public and police services in the government departments of Hong Kong may remain in employment. British and other foreign nationals may also be employed to serve as advisers to government departments of the HKSAR. (5) The current social and economic systems in Hong Kong would remain unchanged, and so would the life-style. Freedoms, including those of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of travel, of movement, of correspondence, and of religious belief would be ensured in the HKSAR. Private property, ownership of enterprises, legitimate right of inheritance and foreign investment would be protected by law. (6) The HKSAR would retain the status of a free port and a separate customs territory. (7) The HKSAR would retain the status of a financial center, and its markets for foreign exchange, gold, securities and futures would continue. There would continue to be a free flow of capital, and the Hong Kong dollar would continue to circulate and remain freely convertible. (8) The HKSAR would have independent finances. (9) The HKSAR may establish mutually beneficial economic relations with the United Kingdom, whose economic interests in Hong Kong would be given due regard. (10) Using the name ""Hong Kong, China,"" the HKSAR may on its own maintain and develop economic and cultural relations and conclude relevant agreements with states, regions and relevant international organizations. The government of the HKSAR may itself issue travel documents for entry into and exit from Hong Kong. (11) The maintenance of public order in the HKSAR would be the responsibility of the government of the HKSAR. And (12) the above-stated policies would be stipulated in the Basic Law of the HKSAR by the NPC of the People's Republic of China (PRC), and they would remain unchanged for 50 years."

According to the white paper, titled the Practice of the ""One Country, Two Systems"" Policy in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the Chinese central government has fully supported the HKSAR in ""meeting various difficulties and challenges"". The white paper noted that the Chinese central government has managed to ensure Hong Kong's economic and financial stability during the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the international financial crisis in 2008. It has also supported the region in the fight against SARS in 2003, which dealt a hard blow to Hong Kong's economy, by providing a large quantity of free medical supplies, promoting trade and investment between the two sides, and by allowing mainland residents to visit Hong Kong on their own. By the end of 2013, some 129 million mainland residents have visited Hong Kong under the Individual Visit Scheme, said the white paper published by the Information Office of China's State Council. According to estimate of the HKSAR government, the scheme contributed to a 1.3-percent increase of Hong Kong's gross regional product in 2012 alone, and helped create more than 110,000 jobs. Meanwhile, the Chinese central government has also taken measures to consolidate Hong Kong's position as a leading offshore RMB market, and has encouraged the listing of mainland enterprises on the stock market in Hong Kong. A series of economic partnership agreements including the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), now allow the Chinese mainland to give zero tariff treatment to all products of Hong Kong origin. Meanwhile, the mainland also made great efforts to ensure the supply of foodstuff, agricultural and sideline products, water, electricity, and natural gas to the HKSAR. Currently, the mainland is the largest trading partner of Hong Kong, while Hong Kong is the mainland's most important trading partner, a key export market and the mainland's largest off-shore financial center. According to Hong Kong statistics, the trade volume between Hong Kong and the mainland reached 3.89 trillion Hong Kong dollars in 2013, 3.5 times that of 1997. In addition, the mainland and Hong Kong are also each other's largest source of overseas direct investment. The white paper said the Chinese central government had supported the HKSAR in stepping up cooperation with mainland provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, and the cross-border infrastructure construction and facilitation for personnel and cargo customs clearance between the two sides. It has also buttressed the two sides' exchanges and cooperation in education, science and technology, and culture as well as between relevant departments of the central government and the HKSAR government."

Whether it's a long layover between flights or a two-day respite from day-to-day life, 48 hours in Hong Kong can put a spring back in one's step - even if you're stepping up one of the city's notoriously steep inclines. If the weather gods are smiling, you'll be able to scale mountains, enjoy a dip in the ocean, ride a wild roller-coaster and dine al fresco under the stars, all in the space of one short weekend. As a US expat who has spent most of my life on one coast or another, I was experiencing serious sea-breeze withdrawal after six months in Beijing. Thus, stepping out of Hong Kong's airport heading to the Le Meridien Cyberport Hotel on the island, I am instantly back in my happy place, as the verdant hills, flower-bedecked trees and moisture-laden air greet me warmly. I'd been advised to opt for the bus as opposed to the airport express train on this, my first visit to the city: The A-10 offered tiers of seating and breathtaking views of the harbors, islands and peaks that make Hong Kong so beautiful. Not only that, but at HK$42 ($5.42), the fare is less than half that of the train, though the bus takes a little longer. I come armed with a wish list for the weekend, starting with dipping my toes in the waters of Repulse Bay or Stanley Beach. So after check-in I take another bus to Repulse Bay. Though the lifeguard stations are reassuringly stationed every 10 meters or so, the only one wading in the bracingly cold water is me. Everywhere I look is a postcard-worthy vista, and the strand is dotted with sightseers in street clothes capturing the awe-inspiring beauty with their cameras. Just south of the luxury high-rises encircling the bay are the red-and-yellow pagodas and bridges of Tin Hau Temple, whose statues are dedicated to protecting the local fishing fleet. Next I take the tram to Victoria Peak, which affords a panoramic though occasionally hazy view of the downtown. A quick cab ride later, I land in Central, where I drop coins in a token machine and soon climb aboard the famous green-and-white Star Ferry, which in a mere 10 minutes deposits me at upscale Kowloon and its glitzy malls. After a stroll, I opt to dine at the Greyhound Cafe near the harbor, a trendy Thai chain with branches in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing. Its tasty Waterfall Grilled Lamb, served on skewers and washed down with an ice-cold Singha beer, hits the spot and gives me the energy to find my way back to the hotel. The next day dawns hot and clear. Although the little kid in me is lobbying for an immediate departure to Lantau Island (and Disneyland), my grown-up self needs caffeine. I ride up one of the mid-level escalators from Hong Kong's Central district, where I find not only a picturesque cafe but also a street dedicated to fresh produce of all kinds. The fresh, crunchy apple I purchase proves the perfect finish to my croissant-and-coffee breakfast, and the bustling, twisty streets are exactly as I have pictured exotic Hong Kong to be. The ride to Lantau is fast and efficient, and the Disney train is a happy place indeed: brimming with children of all ages and decorated with mouse-ear shaped windows and hand-holds. Although compact, HK Disney offers bang for the buck in several ways: Its celebrated fireworks go off nightly behind Cinderella's Castle, and at $58, the tariff at the gate is about 40 percent cheaper than ticket prices in the US. Despite its smaller size, I find all of my old favorites - Space Mountain, It's a Small World, Dumbo the Flying Elephant - along with a new one: Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars, an exciting coaster that speeds forwards and backwards around ""sandstone"" cliffs. Another popular attraction on Lantau is the Tian Tan Buddha. At 250 tons and 34 meters high, it's the world's largest Buddha statue and reachable on the same Tung Chung express train that goes to Disney. By late afternoon, I am back in Central district in pursuit of a cooling beverage at the iconic Mandarin Oriental hotel. Using the futuristic, enclosed walkways Hong Kong is famous for, I head straight through the lobby to the elegant bar, where - feeling like a Bond Girl in the swanky surroundings - I am soon served a somewhat pricey but very delicious whiskey sour. To make my final night in Hong Kong special, I snag a reservation at Quemo, a happening Spanish tapas restaurant I've read about online. As advertised, the food is incredible and the small penthouse space is buzzing with conversation as bottles of wine and sizzling pans of paella whisk past. The staff is attentive and friendly. After dinner, I enjoy a chat with blue-eyed Catalonian head chef Angel Pascual, who shows me around the restaurant, including a charming rooftop drinks terrace. On the relaxing cab ride back to the hotel, stirred by the floral scents and happy chatter that surround me in Hong Kong, I am busy planning my return to Xiang Gang - China's Fragrant Harbor."
